Association for Democratic Reforms,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Democratic_Reforms,"The Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) is an Indian non-partisan, non-governmental organization which works in the area of electoral and political reforms. Along with National Election Watch (NEW), ADR is striving to bring transparency and accountability in Indian politics and reducing the influence of money and muscle power in elections. ADR came into existence in 1999 when a group of Professors from the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Ahmedabad[3] and Bangalore filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) with the Delhi High Court regarding the disclosure of the criminal, financial and educational background of the candidates contesting elections. 
The PIL was upheld by the Delhi High Court in 2000[4] but the Government of India appealed to the Supreme Court of India against the High Court judgement. However, in 2002[5] and subsequently in 2003[6], the Supreme Court made it mandatory for all the candidates contesting elections to disclose their criminal, financial and educational background prior to the polls by filing an affidavit with the Election Commission of India.
The process led to greater awareness among voters of criminal cases against politicians. ADR was co-founded by Trilochan Sastry, Jagdeep S. Chhokar, Ajit Ranade, Sunil Handa, Devanath Tirupati, Brij Kothari, Rajesh Agarwal, Pankaj Chandra, Sudarshan Khanna, Prem Pangotra and P.R. Shukla.[7] It is headed by Maj. Gen. Anil Verma (Retd.).[8] The objective of ADR is to improve governance and strengthen democracy by continuous work in the area of Electoral and Political Reforms.[9] The ambit and scope of work in this field is enormous, hence, ADR has chosen to concentrate its efforts in the following areas pertaining to the political system of the country: Election Watch or Analysis of Affidavits:[10] Election Watch is the flagship programme of ADR. Since 2002, National Election Watch (NEW) and ADR have been conducting Election Watches across the country. As part of this programme, affidavits of candidates contesting elections are minutely examined and citizens are provided with the information about their background details to help them make an informed choice.
The Election Watch has so far collated data of about 1,82,108[11] candidates which can be accessed easily on www.myneta.info.
Election Expenses of MPs and MLAs: ADR also analyses the election expenses declared by elected representatives and the data is released to the media/citizens.
Register of Members’ Interest of Rajya Sabha: ADR also analyses Register of Members’ interest of the Rajya Sabha, which was brought into public domain in June 2011 after ADR’s two-year-long RTI battle. The report contains information regarding remunerative directorship, shareholding of controlling nature, regular remunerative activity, paid consultancy and professional engagement of the Rajya Sabha members. Political Party Watch (PPW):[12] 
ADR’s PPW program is aimed at bringing more transparency and accountability in the functioning of political parties. In 2008, based on an appeal filed by ADR, the Central Information Commission (CIC) declared that the Income Tax Returns of political parties should be made available in the public domain by the IT Department.[13] Since then, ADR has analysed the IT returns of all National and Regional parties of India whose ITR details are available in public domain, from FY 2002-03 till date. An analysis of their Income Tax returns and donations statements filed with the Election Commission of India (ECI) shows that the sources remain largely unknown. ADR analyses the sources of funding of National and Regional political parties. Between FY 2004-05 and FY 2014-15, ADR analysed sources of funding[14] of 6 National and 51 Regional political parties. Legal Advocacy:[20] ADR also resorts to legal advocacy for Political and Electoral Reforms. Time to time ADR takes up various issues in the light of good governance by filing relevant complaints/appeals and PILs/writs with Central Information Commission, Supreme Court/ High Court as well as other Central and State agencies. ADR also attends various consultations/round-tables with bodies like Law Commission of India, Election Commission of India, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha Secretariat. 1. Hum Badlenge Apna Bharat The programme aims to educate senior school children of the challenges faced by Indian Democracy today via workshops. The workshop trainers use videos, audios, quiz papers and other interactive materials to engage with the youth. 2.

The selected Campus Ambassadors are apprised about the issues ADR is working on and their roles and responsibilities as ADR campus representative. All the activities are approved, sponsored, assisted & supervised by the ADR Team. ADR has become the single data point for information/analysis of background details (criminal, financial and others) of politicians and of financial information of political parties.

Association for Social and Environmental Development,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Social_and_Environmental_Development,"The Association for Social and Environmental Development (ASED) is an Indian non-profit organisation headquartered in Kolkata, West Bengal, India and registered under Section 25 of the Indian Companies Act. It promotes nature conservation and an ecologically resilient society, and undertakes programmes for school students. ASED has worked with over 200 schools across the country. It has three flagship programmes, the ""Green Rhinos"" programme, ""Nature Smart"" and ""Nature Club"". These programmes are conducted under the guidance of the Chief Executive Officer, Diti Mookherjee, a Fulbright-Nehru Fellow for Environmental Leadership.[1] Founded by Diti Mookherjee and Rekha Basu on 7 September 2001, the Association for Social and Environmental Development (ASED) was established in order to actively engage youth in nature conservation in a sustained manner.[2] Launched in April 2012, the Green Rhinos programme[3] envisions the existence of an Earth in which the youth, acting as a community, adopts a lifestyle which is ecologically resilient in nature. The programme hopes to fulfil the above objective through the creation of youth nature leaders involved in nature conversation through a transformational leadership process. 
The success of various biodiversity-related projects conducted by the Association for Social and Environmental Development extending from 2004-2010 convinced the Chief Executive Officer of the organisation, Diti Mookherjee, to initiate a structured programme which would involve the active participation of students to develop their own projects relating to conservation. Thus, supported by the Rufford Foundation,[4][5][6] the Green Rhinos programme was established in several schools in the Sundarbans in 2012 after which it was extended to Kolkata, Delhi, Orissa, and Hisar as well to include a total of 17 schools. The methodology [7] of the programme involves the formation of a Green Rhinos team comprising fifty ‘nature smart’ middle school students and two mentors. After nature orientation, seminars, audio-visual presentations, discussions and interactive games, the students are provided with the necessary tools required to create school-based projects which are to be executed in six months. The ASED team helps them to gain access to resources during the stipulated period and once the ten-month program cycle is completed, a ‘sharing workshop’ is held and the Green Rhinos receive a badge and certificate. 
The efforts of the organisation have resulted in the creation of over 3500 Green Rhinos who have successfully conducted various projects such as raising two thousand saplings and planting and nurturing as many as twenty thousand trees in the Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve and creating a butterfly garden within the Maheshtala Girls High School campus.[8]",The Association for Social and Environmental Development ASED is an Indian non profit organisation headquartered in Kolkata West Bengal India and registered under Section 25 of the Indian Companies Act It promotes nature conservation and an ecologically resilient society and undertakes programmes for school students ASED has worked with over 200 schools across the country It has three flagship programmes the Green Rhinos programme Nature Smart and Nature Club These programmes are conducted under the guidance of the Chief Executive Officer Diti Mookherjee a Fulbright Nehru Fellow for Environmental Leadership Founded by Diti Mookherjee and Rekha Basu on 7 September 2001 the Association for Social and Environmental Development ASED was established in order to actively engage youth in nature conservation in a sustained manner Launched in April 2012 the Green Rhinos programme envisions the existence of an Earth in which the youth acting as a community adopts a lifestyle which is ecologically resilient in nature The programme hopes to fulfil the above objective through the creation of youth nature leaders involved in nature conversation through a transformational leadership process The success of various biodiversity related projects conducted by the Association for Social and Environmental Development extending from 2004 2010 convinced the Chief Executive Officer of the organisation Diti Mookherjee to initiate a structured programme which would involve the active participation of students to develop their own projects relating to conservation Thus supported by the Rufford Foundation the Green Rhinos programme was established in several schools in the Sundarbans in 2012 after which it was extended to Kolkata Delhi Orissa and Hisar as well to include a total of 17 schools The methodology of the programme involves the formation of a Green Rhinos team comprising fifty nature smart middle school students and two mentors After nature orientation seminars audio visual presentations discussions and interactive games the students are provided with the necessary tools required to create school based projects which are to be executed in six months The ASED team helps them to gain access to resources during the stipulated period and once the ten month program cycle is completed a sharing workshop is held and the Green Rhinos receive a badge and certificate The efforts of the organisation have resulted in the creation of over 3500 Green Rhinos who have successfully conducted various projects such as raising two thousand saplings and planting and nurturing as many as twenty thousand trees in the Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve and creating a butterfly garden within the Maheshtala Girls High School campus
Audit Bureau of Circulations (India),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit_Bureau_of_Circulations_(India),"The Audit Bureau of Circulations (ABC) of India is a non-profit circulation-auditing organisation. It certifies and audits the circulations of major publications, including newspapers and magazines in India.[1][2] ABC is a voluntary organisation initiated in 1948 that operates in different parts of the world. Until 1948, the concept of circulation audit was yet to be made in India and the publishers had no means to verify the actual circulation number of publications that they used for advertising and had to depend more on their own judgement. Publishers also found it difficult to convince advertisers of the relative values of their publication for the purpose of advertising. It is with this background that eminent representatives of the advertising profession and publishing industry came together to establish an organisation which could serve the common interest. Since then the benefit of ABC certificates of circulation have been availed by advertisers, advertising agencies, publishers and organisations connected with print media advertising. See List of newspapers in India by circulation. ABC (India) was founded in 1948, India.[3] The Publisher should be a Member of Indian Newspaper Society (INS) and the Publications should be registered with Registrar of Newspapers for India (RNI). Publisher members must maintain essential books and records to facilitate a proper ABC audit and also appoint an independent firm of Chartered Accountants from amongst the approved panel of auditors named by ABC. Admission of publishers to ABC membership is subject to a satisfactory admission audit.

Bell Bajao,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Bajao,"Bell Bajao (Hindi for 'ring the bell') is an anti-domestic violence campaign that urges local residents to take a stand against physical abuse through simple acts meant to interrupt domestic violence.[1]  When residents, especially men, overhear violence against a woman taking place, they are urged to ring the doorbell and ask a simple question - such as to borrow some tea, to use the phone, or to have a glass of water. This is meant to let the abuser know that others can hear them and will act to interrupt the violence. The campaign was launched in India on August 20, 2008 by Breakthrough in collaboration with the Ministry of Women and Child Development, UNIFEM and the UN Trust Fund. The global campaign, known in English as Ring The Bell, was launched at the Clinton Global Initiative.[2]  United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon joined the campaign as the inaugural global “champion,” and Breakthrough will join forces with his UNiTE to End Violence Against Women campaign as its first global partner.[3] This campaign promotes individual action against domestic violence. The campaign featured award-winning Public Service Announcements, as well as media and training tools. The campaign targets boys and men and calls on them to intervene if they witness domestic violence. A key aspect of the campaign was thinking of men as partners in ending domestic violence, instead of only as violators. The PSAs reached over 130 million people. Like the ""Is This Justice?"" campaign, this campaign was produced pro bono by the advertising agency Ogilvy and Mather and directed by Bauddhayan Mukherji of Little Lamb Films. Breakthrough is an international human rights organization using the power of popular culture, media, and community mobilization to transform public attitudes and advance equality, justice, and dignity. ""Restore Fairness"" (urges U.S. government to restore due process to US immigration system), ""Is this justice"" (about domestic violence) and ""What kind of man are you"" (about HIV/AIDS and condom usage) are other initiatives in the United States. Most recently, Breakthrough created America 2049 a Facebook game set in a dystopic alternative future which deals with issues of immigration, sex trafficking, and labor rights. Breakthrough addresses critical global issues including violence against women, sexuality and HIV/AIDS, racial justice, and immigrant rights.[4] Violence against Women – Every person in this world is entitled to a fundamental set of human rights that allow her or him to live with dignity and self-respect. For too long, women have been regarded as less than human, and therefore, not entitled to these human rights. Breakthrough works to transform attitudes towards women so that they can realize their full potential. One key example is the Breakthrough Mann Ke Manjeere music video that has become a cult classic that speaks to woman’s celebration of self-discovery and the ability to make choices in life.[5][6] The Bell Bajao! campaign brought attention to domestic violence through a powerful series of PSAs which focused attention to this issue. Breakthrough uses innovative tools to engage youth and create a culture of human rights.

It is also the world's largest television measurement science industry-body. Built upon a robust and future-ready technology backbone, BARC India owns and manages a transparent, accurate, and inclusive TV audience measurement system. Apart from the currency products to the TV industry, BARC India also provides a suite of Insight products designed for broadcasters, advertisers and agencies. The Big Data and Insights generated by BARC India powers efficient media spends and content decisions in a highly dynamic and growing television sector. currently being scaled up to 180,000 individuals, BARC India is also the largest measurement company of its kind in the world. It uses Audio Watermarking technology to measure viewership of TV channels, and the system also allows measurement of time-shifted viewing and simulcasts. The company was incorporated in 2010 and is based in Mumbai, India.[1] With the viewership habits of over 197 million TV households (accounting for 836 million TV viewing individuals)[1] being analysed by BARC India, it is the world's largest television audience measurement service.[2] Its measurement system is based on a sample of 40,000 ""panel homes"" which will go up to 50,000 panel homes.[3] It launched its TV viewership measurement service in April 2015, with coverage of C&S TV homes in towns with a population of 1 lakh and above.[4] In October 2015, it started measuring All India TV homes (TV viewers in urban and rural India)[5] BARC India was planned and executed as an alternative to TAM Media Research Pvt. Ltd, the audience measurement system put in place by information and insights firm Nielsen and Kantar Media, a WPP company.[6] It was set up as per guidelines of the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Government of India.[7] Punit Goenka, MD & CEO, Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd, has been elected as the Chairman of BARC India. Punit succeeds Nakul Chopra, who completed his one-year tenure as Chairman.[8][9] Sunil Lulla is the CEO of BARC India. He took over the reigns from Partho Dasgupta (who was responsible for setting up the company) on 22 October 2019. Romil Ramgarhia is the COO of BARC India. BARC (Broadcast Audience Research Council) India is an industry body set up to design, commission, supervise and own an accurate, reliable and timely television audience measurement system for India. It currently measures TV Viewing habits of 197 million TV households in the country, using 40,000 sample panel homes. This will go up to 50,000 in the next couple of years, as mandated by the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting.[3] Guided by the recommendations of the TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) and MIB notifications of January 2014, BARC India brings together the three key stakeholders in television audience measurement - broadcasters, advertisers, and advertising and media agencies, via their apex bodies. BARC India is committed towards establishing a robust, transparent and accountable governance framework for providing data points that are required to plan media spends more effectively. Standardization Certificates obtained by BARC India are CESP France Certification in April 2017 which validates representativeness of BARC India's TV Measurement Panel and by ISI, Kolkata in May 2018 certifying the representativeness of BARC India's Panel Design & Household Selection Nielsen (the owner of TAM Media along with Kantar Media) was sued by Indian TV channel NDTV for $810 million for fraud and $580 million for negligence in a New York court. NDTV's weighty lawsuit—194 pages; targeted at over 30 companies and individuals; and $1.4 billion in damages—against TAM and its investors accused them of deliberately publishing corrupt and tainted data, favoring rival channels in return for bribes. NDTV also alleged that Nielsen and Kantar were not funding TAM India adequately in order to increase its scale and invest in systems, security and quality procedures. A statement in the lawsuit read: “The primary remedy (of the corrupt activities) was to increase sample size from 8,000 boxes to 30,000 boxes, immediately stopping publication of data until the sample size was increased to appropriate levels.""[10][11][10] The case was dismissed by the New York court on the issue of jurisdiction and asked NDTV to fight the legal battle in India.[12] NDTV subsequently unsubscribed from TAM's services only to subscribe again in May 2014 citing the lack of alternate sources for such data as the TAM provided and the arrival of BARC as a new measuring standard in the industry.[13] After nearly two years of being in the making (2013-2015), BARC's new ratings system formally rolled out in April 2015. Since most broadcasters had decided not to continue their subscription to TAM India, the industry underwent a ratings darkness period since April 1 where the old TAM software had been given up, and the new BARC India ratings software was yet to be installed. The broadcasters had a feel of these ratings a couple of weeks before the official rollout when BARC India made a presentation to share household level data. While there were no major changes, channel ranking across genres, gaps between channels widened or narrowed. The initial rollout of the new ratings included a sample size of 10,000 Bar-o-meters, and covered the towns and cities with a population of 1,00,000 or more. Although this was less than what BARC India had assured to launch with, by October 2015, the sample reporting was scaled up to 20,000 Bar-o-meters, covering all 153 mn TV owning homes in India.[14] The sample has been since scaled up to 30,000 homes. As of 1 July 2017, BARC India has stopped reporting of analogue TV homes, in line with Government of India's DAS-4 deadline. At launch, the following changes were introduced: BIO News: It is a visualisation tool for News broadcasters that gives the performance of News channel, News Stories, News Anchors and Other Personalities at a click of a button.[16] BIO Advision: It is a visualisation tool for Advertisers and Media Agencies which helps brands understand their performance vis-à-vis other brands. PreView: It is a service wherein BARC India subscribers can access the data of a specific event or show, three days after it is telecast. PreView data is also released through the BARC Media Workstation (BMW) software, which is available on subscription.[17] TV + OOH: BARC India now measures and reports TV viewership that happens in social hot-spots like restaurants, pubs, and bars across 120+ Urban towns and cities.[18][19] Spot Trek: Provides reports on advertising monitored spots to the agency The entire BARC India process can be broadly bucketed as follows: · Establishment Survey - A research study used to gather specific details of households and individuals to be used together with Census data in the preparation of universe estimates for TV audience characteristics – geographic, demographic, socio-economic status, etc. The Establishment Survey also serves as a randomly selected pool of TV owning households for use in the ongoing selection and recruitment of panel households · Panel Locations & Identification - Identification of a specific sample locations · Panel Selection and Training- Selection, recruitment, meter installation & training of household members · Panel Management- Supervision of panel operations with strict adherence to established standards · Measurement and Viewing Data Capture- Watermarking and BAR-O-Meter Technology used to identify & capture TV viewing events · Processing, Audience Estimation and Reporting- Process of error checking, editing, validating, weighting, projecting to universe and delivering audience estimates to BARC India clients in a form suitable for reporting, analysis and commercial use · BARC India Media Workstation (BMW)- BARC's desktop software application used to report and analyse audience data in the format required by individual customer segments.[20] BARC India has tied up with DEN Networks,[21] Siti Cable & Airtel Digital TV[22] for measuring TV viewership using Return Path Data (RPD) via their digital set-top boxes (STBs). The move will help expand panel home size from the current 30,000 to over 150,000 in the near future. The large pool of panel households will also help address the issue of panel home tampering plaguing the TV industry in India. As part of this partnership, BARC India will fetch data from STBs of DTH and Multi System Operators (MSOs), who will also use this data for subscriber management, packaging opportunities and to drive advertising revenue on their in-house channels. BARC India is currently in talks with other players for RPD.[23] The RPD initiative in India will be sample based and will exist in addition to BARC India's BAR-O-Meters. After the exit of TAM India from television measurement business in India, one of its parent companies Nielsen has been appointed by BARC India as it digital measurement partner.[24] BARC India's digital measurement service will be made available under the umbrella brand EKAM (Sanskrit for ‘one’), and is promised to be a single platform for all measurement products, across TV and digital.[25] EKAM Pulse, EKAM Beam, EKAM Stream, EKAM Ad-Scan and EKAM Integra are the five products that have been designed based on industry-specific needs. 1. Ekam Pulse: To measure video ad campaigns; will be the first product that will be rolled out. 2. EKAM Beam: To measure linear broadcast that is viewed on a digital device. 3. EKAM Stream: To measure both non-linear and pure play digital video content. 4. EKAM Ad-Scan: A global first-of-its-kind product which will give an overview of digital ads in India, across the competition at an aggregate level. 5. Ekam Integra: Will help the industry with common, robust and independent audience numbers that will give more accurate incremental reach figures. To enable this, BARC India's TV data will be tied with Digital Video data with the help of Single-Source and Digital Booster panels on top of the census measurement and big data. The move is set to be a game changer for the digital content industry and its key stakeholders – broadcasters and advertisers. It is well known that advertising revenue is the dominant business model for most over-the-top streaming platforms, and the ad-revenue depends largely on the reach and viewership which the platform provides. And this, until now, was measured by individual content platforms in-house. This raised issues such as dependency on publishers/platforms for data, lack of quantifiable differences in impressions, inability to see unique and de-duplicated reach and frequency across publishers/platforms and lack of knowledge on return on investment. In order to meet the needs and challenges of digital measurement, BARC India has been guided by its Digital Technical Committee, which has representation from all major players in the sector, including Google, Facebook, Hotstar, Voot, Zee5, Sony, P&G, HUL, Flipkart, GroupM, Madison, IPG and Omnicom Media Group.[26][27] BARC India's Broadcast India Survey is an annual research study that gathers specific details of households and individuals to be used together with Census data in the preparation of universe estimates for TV audience characteristics – geographic, demographic, socio-economic status, etc. The Survey also serves as a randomly selected pool of TV owning households for use in the ongoing selection and recruitment of panel households. Broadcast India 2016 Survey [28] was released in February 2017. The findings of Broadcast India (BI) 2018 Survey[29] was released in July 2018.

publishing corrupt and tainted data favoring rival channels in return for bribes NDTV also alleged that Nielsen and Kantar were not funding TAM India adequately in order to increase its scale and invest in systems security and quality procedures A statement in the lawsuit read The primary remedy of the corrupt activities was to increase sample size from 8 000 boxes to 30 000 boxes immediately stopping publication of data until the sample size was increased to appropriate levels The case was dismissed by the New York court on the issue of jurisdiction and asked NDTV to fight the legal battle in India NDTV subsequently unsubscribed from TAM s services only to subscribe again in May 2014 citing the lack of alternate sources for such data as the TAM provided and the arrival of BARC as a new measuring standard in the industry After nearly two years of being in the making 2013 2015 BARC s new ratings system formally rolled out in April 2015 Since most broadcasters had decided not to continue their subscription to TAM India the industry underwent a ratings darkness period since April 1 where the old TAM software had been given up and the new BARC India ratings software was yet to be installed The broadcasters had a feel of these ratings a couple of weeks before the official rollout when BARC India made a presentation to share household level data While there were no major changes channel ranking across genres gaps between channels widened or narrowed The initial rollout of the new ratings included a sample size of 10 000 Bar o meters and covered the towns and cities with a population of 1 00 000 or more Although this was less than what BARC India had assured to launch with by October 2015 the sample reporting was scaled up to 20 000 Bar o meters covering all 153

The Rural Water Supply & Sanitation project for low income states is being implemented by DWSD, Government of Jharkhand with technical and financial support from Government of India & World Bank. Citizens Foundation is implementing this project in Garhwa & E. Singhbhum districts of Jharkhand. The main objectives of the project are to improve sustainability of drinking water sources, equitable distribution of water and security at household and village level and to assess communities to adopt financially sustain improving institutional capacity at MODWS to decentralized RWSS service delivery. The goal of the Natural Resource Management intervention under Citizens Foundation is to develop the capacity of villagers to effectively participate in NRM initiatives that substantially increase the sustained productivity of their natural resources. A number of initiatives have been undertaken under the NRM programme: Integrated Watershed Management Program (IWMP), Watershed Cell cum Data Centre (WCDC)- Agriculture is the basic practice of occupation for the livelihood of villagers of Jharkhand, but the community is still facing the crisis of water. Watershed initiative is the most significant and sustainable approach for the development especially in the arid region of Jharkhand. The main objective of the project is to provide additional water storage and water conservation measures. The major concern regarding the promotion of water structures is to eradicate the hunger and poverty of the area. Many watershed approaches has been initiated by Citizens Foundation. The water holding capacity of the soil is very poor as result of which even after average 200 cm rainfall, each year the farmers are having scarcity of water for cultivation. The organization is mainly focusing to build up the ideal water conservation approach in the different project areas. The program has been initiated in 25 villages of 3 Districts (Gumla, Lohardaga and Ranchi). Till now the project is directly benefitting 4053 nos. of households and has provided additional irrigation on 4800 hec of land. Another project with the support of  has been initiated in the  (villages, district, state) . The project is directly benefitting 560 nos. of farmers and the additional irrigation on hec of land has been provided. Till now the ongoing work has provided the additional irrigation on acre of land and crop diversity has increased in acre of land. households are directly benefitted through these water reservoirs. Land and Water Management in Jungle Warfare School at Netarhat, Ministry of Welfare, Government of Jharkhand Jungle Warfare School is located at Netarhat in Jharkhand. The entire area is surrounded with dense forest. Most of the streams in this area are seasonal and rejuvenate during monsoon. Due to steep slope and torrential nature of stream during monsoon, most of the stream from upper ridges brings heavy eroded material and deposits in valley areas which causes erosion in the site area. Lack of water storage bodies, high percolation rate in porous soil and prevalence of soil erosion are the main weaknesses of this area. This area receives an average of 1200 mm of rain, but most of this rain is lost due to inadequate water storage and harvesting structures. It causes erosion in the upper ridges and flooding in the valleys. The major concept of the plan is to hold the rain water within the campus for longer duration by constructing water harvesting trenches at the uppermost areas. These trenches will help to recharge the ground water and availability of water round the year in the low land area. As per the field observation and identification of potentiality water sources, 4 locations have been identified for construction of ponds at the lower area of the campus. These ponds will act as permanent water source to serve the total requirement of school. The ultimate plan is to utilize the head water tank constructed earlier for the same purpose. The water will be lifted from the pond to two separate concrete water tanks at preferable location. The water tank at ground level will act as intermediate structure for water storage and direct source of water to water treatment unit which has been proposed to be a purification unit. Finally, the treated water will be lifted to the head water tank and supply the water to different users by channelizing water through pipe line. It is expected that the plan will help to a solution to present water crisis and serve the requirement of the campus for longer duration. Under the Child Protection and Education intervention, Citizens Foundation has undertaken a few initiatives with the objective of promoting growth and development of children, especially those belonging to the marginalized sections of the community. A major initiative under this intervention has been the setting up of Jharkhand State Bal Bhavan (JSBB), on the lines of National Bal Bhavan, New Delhi. In February 2009, Citizens Foundation got affiliated to National Bal Bhavan, New Delhi. The Jharkhand State Bal Bhavan supplements the work of National Bal Bhavan at state level by conducting activities like integration camps, children utsav, environmental conferences, exhibitions and art competitions. It has over 1100 registered students who participate in various seminars and competitions, and undergo training classes in computers and paintings at its centers. JSBB under the aegis of Citizens Foundation also selects the best talent from Jharkhand to represent it at the Bal Shree Honour Awards, awarded by the National Bal Bhavan in New Delhi. The Livelihood Promotion intervention focuses on empowering the tribal population and thus ensuring food security, increased incomes and an increase in the overall quality of life. It builds on the Natural Resource Management in developing resources which can sustainably provide livelihood opportunities for the community. It has identified activities like Homestead Poultry, Goatery Promotion, and Horticulture to enhance livelihood opportunities. A few projects being implemented under this intervention are: Under this intervention, Citizens Foundation is involved in consultancy on Technical, Social and CSR projects across different areas. It provides services in Resettlement and Rehabilitation projects, Natural Resource Management projects, Health, Livelihood, Base Line Studies, concurrent and end line evaluations, impact assessment and collaboration.

Comprehensive Rural Health Project,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Rural_Health_Project,"The Comprehensive Rural Health Project (CRHP) is a non profit, non-governmental organization located in Jamkhed, Ahmednagar District in the state of Maharashtra, India. The organization works with rural communities to provide community-based primary healthcare and improve the general standard of living through a variety of community-led development programs, including Women's Self-Help Groups, Farmers' Clubs, Adolescent Programs and Sanitation and Watershed Development Programs. CRHP was founded in 1970 by Drs. Raj and Mabelle Arole, who conceived the organization's model while on a Fulbright Scholarship at Johns Hopkins University.[1] The work of CRHP has been recognized by the WHO and UNICEF, as well as being introduced to 178 countries across the world. Drs. Raj and Mabelle Arole came from very different backgrounds but found unity in common purpose. Raj Arole, born in 1935, was raised in the village of Rahuri in Ahmednagar District. In contrast, Mabelle Immanuel, born in Jabalpur in 1935, led a secluded and secure life at the college campus where her father was a professor. Mabelle & Raj met during their studies at Christian Medical College, Vellore and graduated in 1959, with Mabelle topping her class and Raj coming second. They found each other in their common purpose of serving the poor and marginalized and were married in April 1960, vowing to each other to devote their lives to this cause. Before founding CRHP in 1970, the couple worked in the Marathi Mission Hospital in Vadala from 1962-1966 and spent time in the US completing their medicine & surgery residencies as well as obtaining MPH degrees at Johns Hopkins University. The idea of CRHP was born during the Aroles’ time at Johns Hopkins and was also based on their prior experiences with the rural poor. They realized that they were seeing the same problems over and over again without producing a solution to the root cause of the ailments they were treating. With this in mind, the Aroles realized the narrow scope of curative medicine was not enough to improve the lives of their patients in a meaningful way. The Aroles decided that they needed to provide holistic care and create empowering framework that galvanized communities to come together to solve their problems sustainably. Over 40 years later, their Jamkhed Model lives on and has been regarded as the most successful template for community-based health and development the world has seen.[2] To understand the link between poverty and health, the Aroles decided to live on the same amount of money that an average village family earned, which was approximately US $7.00 per month [5]. By doing this, they realized that securing food and water was much more important for the people of Jamkhed, than the practice of good public health [6]. The Aroles reached out to donor agencies that funded food-for work programs. Citizens were employed as daily wage laborers to build dams and were paid one bag of grain per week [7]. Health and wellness lessons, and discussions of home-based, low cost prevention and care programs to enhance children’s nutrition, prevent diarrhea, and control pneumonia were provided in conjunction with these construction projects [7]. By providing basic medical care to workers and their children, the Aroles established an initial trust with the residents of Jamkhed. From there, the Aroles were able to start their mission of instituting trained health workers in the villages [1][7]. CRHP’s model, known in the development community as the “Jamkhed Model”,[3] is centered around mobilizing and building the capacity of the community, empowering the people to bring about their own improvements in health and poverty-alleviation. The model has three, mutually supportive components: 1. Village Health Workers and Community Groups The Village Health Worker (VHW), usually illiterate and of low caste, is the key change agent for CRHP’s comprehensive approach to health improvement. Selected by the communities themselves and trained by CRHP, VHWs not only act as health workers and midwives but they also mobilize their communities to achieve better sanitation, hygiene, family planning, and maternal and infant health. When a village agrees to work with CRHP, the whole village comes together to choose a woman to be trained as their VHW. VHWs initially receive extensive training on CRHP’s campus. Over half of the training time is dedicated to personal development in order to build self-esteem, confidence, and skills necessary for community organization and effective communication. The rest of the training is spent developing clinical knowledge and skills that equip the women to function as primary health care workers. The VHWs come together weekly for CRHP-based training to review skills, share stories, and update statistics. VHWs provide basic preventive healthcare and knowledge to their villages and help organize and facilitate Women’s Groups and the Adolescent Girls Programs. VHWs also provide a great deal of care to pregnant women and new mothers. They educate women on nutrition during pregnancy and proper breastfeeding practices. In addition, they examine the pregnant women and monitor the progress of the fetus. VHWs are fully equipped to perform home deliveries and will also accompany women to a hospital delivery if they chose to do so or it is medically necessary. 2. Mobile Health Team The Mobile Heath Team (MHT) found its beginnings in the outreach efforts of founders, Mabelle and Raj Arole, and today serves as the bridge between the community and CRHP’s on-campus medical and development staff. Historically, villagers have had neither the time, nor the resources to travel all the way to the hospital in Jamkhed for care, and as a result, healthcare was brought to them. In order to build trust and confidence, the original outreach team provided curative services via weekly clinics in the villages, and as rapport was built, the original team developed into the MHT. Today the team possesses a broad array of capacities including health promotion, preventive health services, social work, development projects, and community organization. The Mobile Health Team consists of a driver, social workers, a paramedic, and on certain occasions, a physician. However, these distinctions tend to be in name only, and all team members are trained as fully as possible in all jobs and tasks. All team members address patients’ clinical and social questions, and are considered equals with each member given respect and importance. The integration of the team and skill sharing allows for flexibility, and creates a resiliency in our system in the face of unpredictable absences, and personnel shortages.
The Mobile Health Team helps train Village Health Workers and work side by side with them to provide health services to project villages. MHT members help lead and provide support for the Adolescent Boys and Girls Programs, Women’s Self-Help Groups, and Farmers’ Clubs. In addition, the MHT members work with trainees and researchers from all over the world to collect village data and educate others about the Jamkhed Model. 3. Julia Hospital The first hospital at CRHP was created in the 1970s by Drs. Raj and Mabelle Arole to meet the need for medical services in Jamkhed and to build trust in the surrounding communities. When the Aroles first arrived in Jamkhed, they planned to stay a few years, set up a mobile hospital, remedy the health situation, and move on to another area. As the need for medical care surpassed their expectations and the number of patients increased, the need for a permanent hospital did as well. The Old Hospital, built in 1970, served Jamkhed block for 35 years. As CRHP became more involved in secondary care and conducted more surgeries, the need for an even more advanced hospital increased, and in 2009, with the help of a donor, the Julia Hospital was built for USD $1.7 million, including all equipment. The Julia Hospital has 50 beds, three operating theaters, a lab, a maternity ward, an Intensive Care Unit, an X-ray lab, a labor room, and a pharmacy. It serves a rural, underserved population of roughly 500,000 individuals. In the Villages: The health workers were not accepted quickly. It took months or years for a village to start listening, and it was the dramatic decrease in both infant and child mortality rates that helped to cement the role of the village health worker. The women were also supported by a mobile team, established by CRHP. The team was composed of a nurse, paramedic, social worker, and sometimes a doctor. They would visit each village every week in the beginning, then less and less often, only treating the hardest cases. This team was created to not only tackle the most severe illnesses of the villagers, but to reinforce the authority of the Village Health Worker [2][10][11]. Village Health Workers receive intensive training from CRHP in primary health care and health promotion, including family planning, women’s and children’s health and home-birth delivery. Training is also provided in personal and community development, organization and communication skills. These workers share knowledge about health in their respective communities through discussion groups and household visits. During discussions with community members, Village Health Workers address issues such as child care, family planning (contraception use increased from less than 0.5% in 1970, to nearly 60% as on 1999), adequate birth spacing, nutrition, hygiene, sanitation and safe drinking water [9]. They are given a small medical kit and a birthing kit [7]. These women are capable of administering basic remedies and medications, performing safe deliveries, and detecting and referring high-risk pregnancies and deliveries to the CRHP hospital [12]. With the institution of these workers, there has been a significant reduction in child malnutrition, diarrhea, pneumonia, leprosy, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, along with other common diseases associated with standing water from the lack of sanitation and liquid waste disposal systems [6]. Despite these improvement in health care, come problems with this health care worker model were encountered in the villages. Husbands would refuse to allow their wives to become a Village Health Worker or to receive treatment from one. Some women took their new-found sense of freedom and abandoned their husbands and families. In some cases, the Village Health Worker would illegally sell the drugs to the highest bidder or refuse to give treatment without payment. While women were chosen to be health workers through a town consensus, some villages refused to decide and would not accept the new model. In addition, not all women were able to travel to the Jamkhed facility for training. Often, the young woman’s town would be too far away and there would be no bus available. During the monsoon season, very few women could reach the facility at all [7]. Maternal and Child care: Superstition was one of the first obstacles the Village Health Workers had to face. Infant and maternal mortality, along with many other diseases, increased because of such beliefs. To villagers in the Jamkhed area, disease came from the gods [2]. If a new mother died in childbirth, the child was then killed. Villagers saw the mother as unclean, and the child, therefore, unclean. Many cases of maternal death resulted from infections by dirty instruments during the delivery. CRHP trained the Village Health Workers particularly in the methods pregnancy care, such as monitoring blood-pressure and checking for anemia, and in safe and hygienic childbirth. There were other widely accepted superstitions surrounding basic nutrition for pregnant women. They were told not to eat very much, and new mothers would wait several days before starting to breastfeed [2]. The effect of CRHP on childhood mortality, measured from September 1992 to December 2007, showed a 30% reduction in the hazard of child death after the neonatal period for CRHP villages, as compared with villages in the control area. The reduction was significant at the 5% level [12]. Since its conception, CRHP reduced the infant mortality rate from over 200/1000 to approximately 20/1000 (less than half of the figure for the rural area of the state of Maharashtra), with 95% being “safe deliveries” out of the 79% (data for 1999-2003) of home deliveries [2][6][13].
A research project to measure malnutrition and illness among children under five in fifteen CRHP villages, conducted from October to December 2002, showed that malnutrition was less than 15%, while the average for India is greater than 50%. Immunization rates were 99% for measles, DPT, and OPV vaccinations in CRHP villages [14]. Empowering Women: The Aroles believed that preventative medicine begins by identifying the root of the problem. Gender inequality was one of the first major targets CRHP wanted to attack [7]. Most female villagers were married before the age of 10, started having children before 14, were beaten by their husbands (according to a 1996 UNICEF survey, up to 45% of men in India acknowledged physically abusing their wives), and eventually abandoned by them [2][11]. In each village, the Aroles asked the Village Health Worker to form an Adolescent Girls Program. The program teaches girls, ages 12–18, health education and personal development, and self-defense, and fosters discussion and creative activities in order to promote self-esteem and a sense of empowerment [15]. As a result, more women are postponing marriage until 18, the use of contraception and voluntary hysterectomies have reduced family size, and more girls are attending school [2]. Additionally, CRHP helps village women to receive micro-credit loans from local banks and provides them a means to become economically independent. The loans allow the women to earn their own living, generally by selling vegetables or raising farm animals [9]. The Aroles chose young women as Village Health Workers to begin the process of breaking down gender inequality, but contributing factors are still heavily present—socioeconomic class, son preference, early marriage and pregnancy, and violence. Qualitative research of Jamkhed’s surrounding area has supported the success of these programs. Adolescent Girl Program members are seen to have more knowledge about nutrition, reproductive health, maternal health, hygiene, and sanitation, and are found to have healthier weights and other health indicators, as compared to non-members [3][8][15]. A 2010 study used qualitative methods and surveyed 18 Village Health Workers and found 6 themes consistent with a successful approach to empowering women. These included trusted sources of knowledge, effective learning methods and environment(s), qualities of effective Village Health Workers, defeating stigma, empowerment through critical assessment and community organizing, and motivation to serve [16]. 2011 Times of India Social Impact Award, Category: Health- NGO[4] 2010 Gordon-Wyon Award for Excellence in Community-Oriented Public Health, Epidemiology and Practice[5] 2005 Mother Teresa Memorial National Award for Social Justice 2004 Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Dalit Mitra Award for work among marginalized classes 2003 Diwaliben Mehta Award for Tribal Work 2001 Schwab Foundation Social Entrepreneur Award 2001 National Award for Work among Tribal People 2000 R.B.

Baltimore : Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.",The Comprehensive Rural Health Project CRHP is a non profit non governmental organization located in Jamkhed Ahmednagar District in the state of Maharashtra India The organization works with rural communities to provide community based primary healthcare and improve the general standard of living through a variety of community led development programs including Women s Self Help Groups Farmers Clubs Adolescent Programs and Sanitation and Watershed Development Programs CRHP was founded in 1970 by Drs Raj and Mabelle Arole who conceived the organization s model while on a Fulbright Scholarship at Johns Hopkins University The work of CRHP has been recognized by the WHO and UNICEF as well as being introduced to 178 countries across the world Drs Raj and Mabelle Arole came from very different backgrounds but found unity in common purpose Raj Arole born in 1935 was raised in the village of Rahuri in Ahmednagar District In contrast Mabelle Immanuel born in Jabalpur in 1935 led a secluded and secure life at the college campus where her father was a professor Mabelle Raj met during their studies at Christian Medical College Vellore and graduated in 1959 with Mabelle topping her class and Raj coming second They found each other in their common purpose of serving the poor and marginalized and were married in April 1960 vowing to each other to devote their lives to this cause Before founding CRHP in 1970 the couple worked in the Marathi Mission Hospital in Vadala from 1962 1966 and spent time in the US completing their medicine surgery residencies as well as obtaining MPH degrees at Johns Hopkins University The idea of CRHP was born during the Aroles time at Johns Hopkins and was also based on their prior experiences with the rural poor They realized that they were seeing the same problems over and over again without producing a solution to the root cause of the ailments they were treating With this in mind the Aroles realized the narrow scope of curative medicine was not enough to improve the lives of their patients in a meaningful way The Aroles decided that they needed to provide holistic care and create empowering framework that galvanized communities to come together to solve their problems sustainably Over 40 years later their Jamkhed Model lives on and has been regarded as the most successful template for community based health and development the world has seen To understand the link between poverty and health the Aroles decided to live on the same amount of money that an average village family earned which was approximately US 7 00 per month By doing this they realized that securing food and water was much more important for the people of Jamkhed than the practice of good public health The Aroles reached out to donor agencies that funded food for work programs Citizens were employed as daily wage laborers to build dams and were paid one bag of grain per week Health and wellness lessons and discussions of home based low cost prevention and care programs to enhance children s nutrition prevent diarrhea and control pneumonia were provided in conjunction with these construction projects By providing basic medical care to workers and their children the Aroles established an initial trust with the residents of Jamkhed From there the Aroles were able to start their mission of instituting trained health workers in the villages CRHP s model known in the development community as the Jamkhed Model is centered around mobilizing and building the capacity of the community empowering the people to bring about their own improvements in health and poverty alleviation The model has three mutually supportive components 1 Village Health Workers and Community Groups The Village Health Worker VHW usually illiterate and of low caste is the key change agent for CRHP s comprehensive approach to health improvement Selected by the communities themselves and trained by CRHP VHWs not only act as health workers and midwives but they also mobilize their communities to achieve better sanitation hygiene family planning and maternal and infant health When a village agrees to work with CRHP the whole village comes together to choose a woman to be trained as their VHW VHWs initially receive extensive training on CRHP s campus Over half of the training time is dedicated to personal development in order to build self esteem confidence and skills necessary for community organization and effective communication The rest of the training is spent developing clinical knowledge and skills that equip the women to function as primary health care workers The VHWs come together weekly for CRHP based training to review skills share stories and update statistics VHWs provide basic preventive healthcare and knowledge to their villages and help organize and facilitate Women s Groups and the Adolescent Girls Programs VHWs also provide a great deal of care to pregnant women and new mothers They educate women on nutrition during pregnancy and proper breastfeeding practices In addition they examine the pregnant women and monitor the progress of the fetus VHWs are fully equipped to perform home deliveries and will also accompany women to a hospital delivery if they chose to do so or it is medically necessary 2 Mobile Health Team The Mobile Heath Team MHT found its beginnings in the outreach efforts of founders Mabelle and Raj Arole and today serves as the bridge between the community and CRHP s on campus medical and development staff Historically villagers have had neither the time nor the resources to travel all the way to the hospital in Jamkhed for care and as a result healthcare was brought to them In order to build trust and confidence the original outreach team provided curative services via weekly clinics in the villages and as rapport was built the original team developed into the MHT Today the team possesses a broad array of capacities including health promotion preventive health services social work development projects and community organization The Mobile Health Team consists of a driver social workers a paramedic and on certain occasions a physician However these distinctions tend to be in name only and all team members are trained as fully as possible in all jobs and tasks All team members address patients clinical and social questions and are considered equals with each member given respect and importance The integration of the team and skill sharing allows for flexibility and creates a resiliency in our system in the face of unpredictable absences and personnel shortages The Mobile Health Team helps train Village Health Workers and work side by side with them to provide health services to project villages MHT members help lead and provide support for the Adolescent Boys and Girls Programs Women s Self Help Groups and Farmers Clubs In addition the MHT members work with trainees and researchers from all over the world to collect village data and educate others about the Jamkhed Model 3 Julia Hospital The first hospital at CRHP was created in the 1970s by Drs Raj and Mabelle Arole to meet the need for medical services in Jamkhed and to build trust in the surrounding communities When the Aroles first arrived in Jamkhed they planned to stay a few years set up a mobile hospital remedy the health situation and move on to another area As the need for medical care surpassed their expectations and the number of patients increased the need for a permanent hospital did as well The Old Hospital built in 1970 served Jamkhed block for 35 years As CRHP became more involved in secondary care and conducted more surgeries the need for an even more advanced hospital increased and in 2009 with the help of a donor the Julia Hospital was built for USD 1 7 million including all equipment The Julia Hospital has 50 beds three operating theaters a lab a maternity ward an Intensive Care Unit an X ray lab a labor room and a pharmacy It serves a rural underserved population of roughly 500 000 individuals In the Villages The health workers were not accepted quickly It took months or years for a village to start listening and it was the dramatic decrease in both infant and child mortality rates that helped to cement the role of the village health worker The women were also supported by a mobile team established by CRHP The team was composed of a nurse paramedic social worker and sometimes a doctor They would visit each village every week in the beginning then less and less often only treating the hardest cases This team was created to not only tackle the most severe illnesses of the villagers but to reinforce the authority of the Village Health Worker Village Health Workers receive intensive training from CRHP in primary health care and health promotion including family planning women s and children s health and home birth delivery Training is also provided in personal and community development organization and communication skills These workers share knowledge about health in their respective communities through discussion groups and household visits During discussions with community members Village Health Workers address issues such as child care family planning contraception use increased from less than 0 5 in 1970 to nearly 60 as on 1999 adequate birth spacing nutrition hygiene sanitation and safe drinking water They are given a small medical kit and a birthing kit These women are capable of administering basic remedies and medications performing safe deliveries and detecting and referring high risk pregnancies and deliveries to the CRHP hospital With the institution of these workers there has been a significant reduction in child malnutrition diarrhea pneumonia leprosy HIV AIDS tuberculosis and malaria along with other common diseases associated with standing water from the lack of sanitation and liquid waste disposal systems Despite these improvement in health care come problems with this health care worker model were encountered in the villages Husbands would refuse to allow their wives to become a Village Health Worker or to receive treatment from one Some women took their new found sense of freedom and abandoned their husbands and families In some cases the Village Health Worker would illegally sell the drugs to the highest bidder or refuse to give treatment without payment While women were chosen to be health workers through a town consensus some villages refused to decide and would not accept the new model In addition not all women were able to travel to the Jamkhed facility for training Often the young woman s town would be too far away and there would be no bus available During the monsoon season very few women could reach the facility at all Maternal and Child care Superstition was one of the first obstacles the Village Health Workers had to face Infant and maternal mortality along with many other diseases increased because of such beliefs To villagers in the Jamkhed area disease came from the gods If a new mother died in childbirth the child was then killed Villagers saw the mother as unclean and the child therefore unclean Many cases of maternal death resulted from infections by dirty instruments during the delivery CRHP trained the Village Health Workers particularly in the methods pregnancy care such as monitoring blood pressure and checking for anemia and in safe and hygienic childbirth There were other widely accepted superstitions surrounding basic nutrition for pregnant women They were told not to eat very much and new mothers would wait several days before starting to breastfeed The effect of CRHP on childhood mortality measured from September 1992 to December 2007 showed a 30 reduction in the hazard of child death after the neonatal period for CRHP villages as compared with villages in the control area The reduction was significant at the 5 level Since its conception CRHP reduced the infant mortality rate from over 200 1000 to approximately 20 1000 less than half of the figure for the rural area of the state of Maharashtra with 95 being safe deliveries out of the 79 data for 1999 2003 of home deliveries A research project to measure malnutrition and illness among children under five in fifteen CRHP villages conducted from October to December 2002 showed that malnutrition was less than 15 while the average for India is greater than 50 Immunization rates were 99 for measles DPT and OPV vaccinations in CRHP villages Empowering Women The Aroles believed that preventative medicine begins by identifying the root of the problem Gender inequality was one of the first major targets CRHP wanted to attack Most female villagers were married before the age of 10 started having children before 14 were beaten by their husbands according to a 1996 UNICEF survey up to 45 of men in India acknowledged physically abusing their wives and eventually abandoned by them In each village the Aroles asked the Village Health Worker to form an Adolescent Girls Program The program teaches girls ages 12 18 health education and personal development and self defense and fosters discussion and creative activities in order to promote self esteem and a sense of empowerment As a result more women are postponing marriage until 18 the use of contraception and voluntary hysterectomies have reduced family size and more girls are attending school Additionally CRHP helps village women to receive micro credit loans from local banks and provides them a means to become economically independent The loans allow the women to earn their own living generally by selling vegetables or raising farm animals The Aroles chose young women as Village Health Workers to begin the process of breaking down gender inequality but contributing factors are still heavily present socioeconomic class son preference early marriage and pregnancy and violence Qualitative research of Jamkhed s surrounding area has supported the success of these programs Adolescent Girl Program members are seen to have more knowledge about nutrition reproductive health maternal health hygiene and sanitation and are found to have healthier weights and other health indicators as compared to non members A 2010 study used qualitative methods and surveyed 18 Village Health Workers and found 6 themes consistent with a successful approach to empowering women These included trusted sources of knowledge effective learning methods and environment s qualities of effective Village Health

Foundation for Ecological Security,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_for_Ecological_Security,"The Foundation for Ecological Security (FES) is a registered non-profit organisation based in Anand, Gujarat, India working towards the ecological restoration and conservation of land and water resources in ecologically fragile, degraded and marginalised regions of the country, through concentrated and collective efforts of village communities. FES has been involved in assisting the restoration, management and governance of Common Property Land Resources since 1986. The organisation uses a holistic approach to resource management by “intertwining principles of nature conservation and local self-governance in order to accelerate ecological restoration, as well as improve the living conditions of the poor.”[1] Most of FES’ efforts are concentrated in the dryland regions of the country; however the landscapes worked on are as diverse as scrub lands, tidal mudflats, dense forests, ravines, grasslands, farm fields and water bodies. Registered under the Societies Registration Act XXI 1860, the Foundation for Ecological Security was set up in 2001 to strengthen the “massive and critical task of ecological restoration” and improve the governance of natural resources in India. According to their website the mission statement of the organization is, “As ‘ecological security’ is the foundation of sustainable and equitable development, the Foundation for Ecological Security (FES) is committed to strengthening, reviving or restoring, where necessary, the process of ecological succession and the conservation of land, forest and water resources in the country.”[2] Given its presence at various levels of governance – from villages and districts to the state and national level – FES is well poised to voice local concerns on regional, national and global platforms. FES works towards centre-staging ecological agenda alongside priorities of economic growth, reorienting progress from the standpoint of conservation and social justice, and presenting local visions and voices at both local and global levels. Working from a systems perspective, efforts are aimed at three fundamental dimensions (and their interfaces) of rural life: ecological restoration, local governance, and livelihoods. FES uses a holistic approach to resource management that includes securing legal rights for rural communities, strengthening village institutions, restoration of the degraded landscapes and improving the long-term sustainability of natural resources.[3] Most contemporary initiatives on livelihood promotion do not take into account the threshold limits of ecosystems and instead push for an exploitative trend that is obviously untenable in the long run. FES, however, strives to highlight the threshold limits of the given agro-ecological system so as to aid communities in determining consumption levels within the ecological capacity of the area, by highlighting natural resource-based livelihood options that are ecologically sound and economically rewarding. FES’ work with land, water and people is governed by a deep understanding of interrelationships – inter-relationships between natural and human systems, between different ecosystems within a landscape, and between different elements within an ecosystem, as also the inter-linkages between Commons, livestock and agriculture. The organisation's efforts focus on strengthening systemic drivers (such as soil, moisture, nutrients, pollinators and biodiversity) and the natural inter-linkages between various elements of the farming system, while parallelly aiding village communities in strengthening community institutions for local self-governance and in this way, adding to the resilience of both rural landscapes and people's endeavours. FES works through local self-governance institutions to promote the judicious management of natural resources, partnering with village communities committed to restoring ecosystems and landscapes, and crafting suitable institutional spaces which safeguard the interests of the poor. In various parts of the country, alongside community institutions, FES joins hands with civil society, academia, local elected representatives and government functionaries to promote informed stewardship and concerted action towards restoring ecological health. FES also leverages funds available under Rural Employment Guarantee Programmes and channels their effective utilisation to restore degraded landscapes and revitalise local self-governance institutions.[4] FES has considerable experience in building capacities of representatives of village institutions, Panchayats, government and non-government officials, who can steer development processes at the village level in areas of local governance and stewardship of natural resources. In 2011, FES initiated Prakriti Karyashala or rural colleges to assist communities and local self-governance institutions in shaping and translating their visions of local development and filling the gaps in knowledge, leadership and skills. The Karyashala offers programmes to Village Forest Committees along forest fringes in Rajasthan and Orissa, to village institutions integrating MGNREGA and managing Commons in Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh, and on watershed associations planning to monitor hydrological changes and craft usage regulations in Andhra Pradesh. FES is one of the largest organizations focused on giving India's rural poor rights to common land (“the Commons”).[3] Commons in India have been continuously projected as 'wastelands' and diverted for alternate uses such as biofuel cultivation, corporate contract farming and industrial zones. While more than 90% of India's population depends on the Commons for their livelihood, few have formal rights to these resources. To challenge the growing threats that Commons face from their reallocation, over exploitation and encroachment, FES launched the ‘Commons Initiative’ in 2009.[5] The Initiative aims to build strategic collaborations and bring together practitioners, decision-makers and scholars for a long-term campaign that would influence policy and programmatic action on Commons in India. In this regard, FES works towards representing landless communities, organizing long-term leasing arrangements and securing tenure with State governments.[3] FES undertakes studies to help locate its work in the larger context and designs pursuits that are both grounded and technically rigorous, while providing a sound basis for influencing policy. The studies are designed to engage local communities in search of suitable solutions and build on their knowledge for informed community-level action for ecological restoration, natural resource management and institution building. A comprehensive framework has also been developed to study ecological, social and economic issues in representative locations and to monitor changes over a period of time in order to upgrade the effectiveness of our work at the village and landscape level. 
FES has a well developed Geographic Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing Facility that supports these studies with spatial information, representation and analysis. In 2010, FES launched Indian Biodiversity Information System (IBIS),[6] a web-based modular and searchable portal to provide reliable species-level information on a single user-friendly platform. Catering to a wide range of stakeholder groups, ranging from amateur wildlife enthusiasts to serious researchers, conservationists and educationists, IBIS aims at becoming a crucial tool for achieving conservation goals in the subcontinent. As of March, 2013 FES works with 28 districts in 7 states of the country engaging with 5323 village institutions and protecting around 4,71,521 hectares of revenue wastelands, forest lands and Panchayat grazing lands creating a difference in the lives of 28,95,024 individuals. The central theme of work done by FES revolves around intertwining principles of nature conservation and strengthening village institutions so as to directly improve the living conditions of the poor and the marginalised. FES support Panchayats and their subcommittees, Village Forest Committees, Gramya Jungle Committees, Water Users Associations and Watershed Committees. Regardless of the form of the institution, FES strives for a future where local village communities determine and move towards desirable land-use based on principles of conservation and social justice.[3] FES collaborates with several practitioner and academic bodies engaged in ecological restoration, community institutions and rural livelihoods. FES partners with the Dakshin Foundation to publish Common Voices[7] and Current Conservation.[8] With Kalpavriksh, FES brings out the Protected Area Update[9] and Forest Case Update.[10] In collaboration with Collective Action and Property Rights (CAPRi), FES seeks to advance common interests on collective action and property rights of communities through developing effective advocacy, communication, and training materials. FES collaborates with different universities: Washington University, St. Louis, to study subjects related to systems dynamics,[11] energy conservation,[12] coupled human and natural systems;[13] Clemson University, USA, on hydrological studies;[14] University of Michigan, Ann Arbor,[15] and University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign,[16] and Indiana University, Bloomington,[17] on forest resource institutions and climate change. FES anchors the Rainfed Livestock Network (RLN),[18] a consortium of NGOs which works to highlight issues related to livestock rearers in rainfed areas of India. FES is also a member of the ‘Future of Conservation’ consortium, and Revitalization of Rainfed Agricultural Network.[19] FES is currently a member of the World Conservation Union (IUCN),[20] International Land Coalition (ILC),[21] International Association for the Study on the Commons (IASC),[22] International Society of Ecological Economics (ISEE) and its Indian chapter,[23] the Indigenous and Community Conserved Areas (ICCA) Consortium, and the UN Economic and Social Council (UNECOSOC).[24] FES has been supported by many funding partners over the years, including Arghyam, Concern Worldwide, The Duleep Matthai Nature Conservation Trust, Fondation Ensemble, Ford Foundation, Department of Rural Development (Government of Andhra Pradesh), Department of Rural Development (Government of Gujarat), Department of Rural Development (Government of Andhra Rajasthan), Grow-Trees, Hilton Foundation, Irrigation and Command Area Development (I&CAD) Department (Government of Andhra Pradesh), ITC – Sunehra Kal Initiative, National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), Omidyar Network,[25] Royal Bank of Scotland Foundation, Rufford Small Grant Programme, Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the Allied Trusts (SDTT), Jamsetji Tata Trust (JTT), Sir Ratan Tata Trust (SRTT), Water and Sanitation Management Organisation (WASMO), UNDP-GEF Small Grants Programme (SGP), and GIZ.[26] FES was a recipient of the Skoll Award for Social Entrepreneurship in 2015, and Jagdeesh Rao was honored during the awards ceremony as part of the Skoll World Forum in Oxford, England on 16 April 2015.[27] In 2013, FES was awarded the Times of India Social Impact Award 2012 in the Environment category. It was jointly shared with Dhan Foundation.[28] On the World Day to Combat Desertification (17 June) the Foundation for Ecological Security was awarded the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) instituted Land for Life Award 2013 for its work on assisting village communities in sustainable management of common lands in India.[29] The Foundation for Ecological Security

Friends of Tribals Society,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends_of_Tribals_Society,"The Friends of Tribals Society (FTS), or Vanbandhu Parishad, is a volunteer organization formed in 1989 with the goal of improving literacy and health among the Adivasi, rural tribal people in India. The society operates one-teacher schools in the villages, led by trained members of the local community.[1] The FTS is associated with the Ekal Vidyalaya Foundation, which is active in fundraising abroad.[2]
FTS operates Ekal Vidyalayas in Assam, Orissa, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Karnataka, while its sister organization Bharat Lok Shiksha Parishad (BLSP) operates in Uttar Pradesh, Uttranchal, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir.[3] The schools (Ekal Vidyalyas) are led by a local person who is trained as a teacher. The curriculum is mainly basic literacy in the language of the state, but also introduces concepts of Hinduism, even in areas where that is not the main religion.[4]
An Ekal Vidyalaya teacher was killed by Naxalites for ignoring their directive not to teach Hindu culture.[5]
As of July 2003, the FTS was operating 6,966 schools with 222,775 students.[4]
By July 2007, the FTS and the Ekal Vidyalaya was operating over 23,000 schools.[6]
The FTS had the goal of operating 30,000 schools by 2011.[7]
The target was achieved and surpassed by March 2010 itself reaching 34,000 schools with 10,30,290 students.[citation needed] The society is associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which belongs to the Sangh Parivar, a Hindu nationalist organization, although FTS officials claim to be independent of these organizations. After a 2004 electoral victory by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Madhya Pradesh, the Human Resources Development minister Murli Manohar Joshi gave credit to the FTS for helping achieve the BJP victory.[4]
In May 2005, the Union Human Resource Development Ministry stopped grants to the FTS for their schools after an inquiry reported that the organization was misusing this funding. The FTS was said to be inflating their school registers, failing to provide educational material and teaching divisive ideology.[8]
In December 2010 the State Bank of India donated money to purchase teaching materials for 150 one-teacher schools in the Patna area.[9]",The Friends of Tribals Society FTS or Vanbandhu Parishad is a volunteer organization formed in 1989 with the goal of improving literacy and health among the Adivasi rural tribal people in India The society operates one teacher schools in the villages led by trained members of the local community The FTS is associated with the Ekal Vidyalaya Foundation which is active in fundraising abroad FTS operates Ekal Vidyalayas in Assam Orissa Bihar Jharkhand Madhya Pradesh Chhattisgarh Maharashtra and Karnataka while its sister organization Bharat Lok Shiksha Parishad BLSP operates in Uttar Pradesh Uttranchal Himachal Pradesh Haryana Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir The schools Ekal Vidyalyas are led by a local person who is trained as a teacher The curriculum is mainly basic literacy in the language of the state but also introduces concepts of Hinduism even in areas where that is not the main religion An Ekal Vidyalaya teacher was killed by Naxalites for ignoring their directive not to teach Hindu culture As of July 2003 the FTS was operating 6 966 schools with 222 775 students By July 2007 the FTS and the Ekal Vidyalaya was operating over 23 000 schools The FTS had the goal of operating 30 000 schools by 2011 The target was achieved and surpassed by March 2010 itself reaching 34 000 schools with 10 30 290 students citation needed The society is associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh RSS which belongs to the Sangh Parivar a Hindu nationalist organization although FTS officials claim to be independent of these organizations After a 2004 electoral victory by the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP in Madhya Pradesh the Human Resources Development minister Murli Manohar Joshi gave credit to the FTS for helping achieve the BJP victory In May 2005 the Union Human Resource Development Ministry stopped grants to the FTS for their schools after an inquiry reported that the organization was misusing this funding The FTS was said to be inflating their school registers failing to provide educational material and teaching divisive ideology In December 2010 the State Bank of India donated money to purchase teaching materials for 150 one teacher schools in the Patna area

Gender and Trade Initiative,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_and_Trade_Initiative,"The Gender and Trade Initiative (GATI) is an initiative of the Society for Conflict Analysis and Resolution (SOFCAR) a New Delhi-based research and advocacy organisation. GATI was launched in November 2004 with the support and guidance of UNIFEM South Asia Regional Office (UNIFEM-SARO) to focus on critical issues relating to Gender and Trade in South Asia and beyond. It originated with the realization that gender and trade issues have not been accorded their due importance by researchers and advocacy groups alike. Often, trade policies have been characterized as gender neutral. However, increasingly there is a growing recognition of the fact that the processes of globalization are associated with rapid changes in forms of work and life and have clear differential impacts on gender relations and outcomes. The core objective of GATI has been to conduct credible evidence based research on the subject, provide policy inputs and promote a wider awareness and debate on the theme. Essentially, since the terms of the debate have been couched in technical jargons and the same needs to be demystified and communicated in a simple format to non-specialist audience. GATI is a partner of UNIFEM-SARO and the Commonwealth Secretariat. It maintains active links with trade and gender experts in academic institutions and in civil society across South Asia, Africa and other Commonwealth nations. Currently GATI maintains a web-based resource centre on gender and trade related issues in partnership with the Commonwealth Secreatriat. The website was launched at the 8th Commonwealth Women's Affairs Ministers Meeting (8WAMM) held in Uganda, 11–14 June 2007 with an idea to provide a platform interlinking research, advocacy and action across the Commonwealth countries with the objective of facilitating and promoting gender sensitive trade policies at the national, regional and multilateral levels.

It is an online donation platform and aims to channel and provide resources to credible non-governmental organisations across India.[1] As a web portal, it helps raise funds and contributions from individuals across India and the world and then disburses these donations to credible Indian NGOs. After a rigorous  and thorough document based due diligence, supplemented by a visit or a strong reference, GiveIndia lists NGOs on its website. As of April 2011, GiveIndia has selected over 270 charitable organisations that are recommended on its website after reviewing more than 3,000 nonprofit organisations from all over India. GiveIndia works across ten causes and lists charities ranging from charity for children to charity for education, health, employment, elderly, disability, human rights, environment, youth and women's empowerment. 
GiveIndia also lets its donors know where exactly their donation was used and also give them a proof of it through a feedback report.[2] Every feedback report contains the details of the beneficiaries who were benefited from each donation. GiveInida also issues an instant e-tax receipt upon making a donation. The donations are either 80G (50% tax exempt) or 35AC (100% tax exempt). GiveIndia has one of the lowest costs of fundraising in India.[3] GiveIndia ensures that at least 90% of every donation reaches the organisation that is donated to (as against the average of 60% for the NGO sector).[4] GiveIndia was conceived in 1999 by IIM-A graduate Venkat Krishnan. It is run and managed by a team of professionals. Venkat Krishnan wanted to create a credible link between people willing to donate and credible grass-root NGOs which work for the poorest of the poor. GiveIndia was started with the mission to create a culture of giving in India.[5][6] Most of these NGOs do not have adequate systems in place to raise awareness about their causes and consequently have difficulty raising funds to support these causes. GiveIndia does not undertake any charitable functions directly. Instead, it channels funds provided by donors to certified non-profit organizations across India. Non-profit organizations who wish to partner with GiveIndia need to satisfy a minimum set of conditions known as ""credibility alliance norms."" Among other criteria, organizations must have no political ties and at least fifty percent of their beneficiaries must be economically underprivileged. Donors visit GiveIndia website and donate online to their preferred Indian NGOs and the donations are then disbursed to those NGOs. GiveIndia was created to allow secure donation options for potential donors and provide them with access to over one hundred NGOs.[citation needed] As of April 2014, since GiveIndia's inception, over 2,00,000 donors across the globe have been involved in supporting 270 organizations through GiveIndia.[7] Over the last decade, they have channeled over Rs. 130 crores to more than 270 NGOs all over India, impacting over 1 million lives. From 2011-2012, the organization channeled over $4.4 million to over 270 NGO's and over 91% of these funds were raised in India.[8]  They launched India's first ""online philanthropy marketplace"" (a website where people can donate to causes of their own choice) in September 2000.
GiveIndia introduced the concept of Marathon-based fundraising in India. . Though, it is not associated with marathons such as the Mumbai Marathon, it was the official charity partner to the Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon (SCMM) and Vodafone Delhi Half Marathon (VDHM). GiveIndia mainly raises funds for NGOs through various channels such as payroll giving, retail giving, client services and other fund raising events. GiveIndia  launched an online Payroll giving program in 2004 through which employees of the organization may pledge a certain portion of their monthly income towards charity every month.[9] These monthly contributions accumulate in an online account that GiveIndia creates for each employee. Employees can log into their online accounts and donate to an NGO or cause of their choice from the accumulated sum. The funds are channeled to the respective NGOs by GiveIndia every month. Organisations like Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Cadbury, Reliance, ITC, HDFC Bank, NDTV, STAR TV, ICICI Bank, BBC, KPMG, McKinsey & Company and several others are part of GiveIndia's Payroll Giving Family all over India.[10][11] The Payroll Giving program already has more than 30,000 donors across over 125 companies contributing over Rs. 8 crores per month, and is growing fast.[12] GiveIndia pioneered online donations in India in the year 2000 and was one of the first worldwide. GiveIndia has channeled over Rs 6 crores to various non-profit organizations through the Internet.
GiveIndia’s site is designed as a ""Philanthropy Exchange"" that allows donors to donate directly to any of the ""listed"" non-profit organisations.[13] GiveIndia has launched the First Givers Club (FGC) in 2010. Nitin Nohria, from Harvard Business School, was one of the keynote speakers in the first summit held by First Givers Club in 2010.[14] In the Annual summit in 2010, 100 high-net-worth individuals pledged to give money and time to charity.[15] In the Annual Summit in 2011, Azim Premji and Rakesh Jhunjhunwala were the key note speakers.[16] Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, an Indian investor and trader, pledged to give away 25% of his wealth during his lifetime.[17][18] GiveIndia offers individuals and organizations the option to raise funds for a cause they wish to promote personally.[19] Utilizing the GiveIndia portal, individuals can create their own customized iGive page, send it out to friends, family and social networks. All funds raised are then channeled by GiveIndia to the individual or cause chosen. iGive ceased to exit from the financial year 2018-19. GiveIndia has been selective in identifying events to raise funds for charity. The traditional model of organizing events results in more than 80 percent of the resources raised being spent on the event itself. So by ""piggybacking"" existing events that are already planned, GiveIndia ensures that the cost of fundraising is less than 10%, to contribute more towards a cause. It was the official charity partner to the Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon (SCMM)[20] & Vodafone Delhi Half Marathon (VDHM).GiveIndia hosted a unique event - Engagement Evening - on November 17, 2006, that spread knowledge about the philanthropy marketplace and also celebrated the listing of NGOs GiveIndia also plays a major role in organising the Joy of Giving Week, which is celebrated around the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi on October 2.

Gram Vikas,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram_Vikas,"Gram Vikas is an Indian non-governmental organisation based in Orissa, and founded in 1979.[1] It uses common concerns for water and sanitation to unite and empower rural communities, including adivasi communities. ""Gram Vikas"" translates to ""village development"", both in Hindi and in Oriya, the official language of Orissa.[2] In 1971, Joe Madiath led 400 volunteers from the University of Madras' Young Students' Movement for Development to West Bengal to manage relief camps for refugees of the Bangladesh Liberation War. Witnessing the devastation of the 1971 Orissa cyclone, and realising the comparatively little attention received by the disaster victims, Madiath and a small group of 40 volunteers shifted their attention there.[3] The group decided that the best way to help the cyclone victims was to provide irrigation facilities. Once these efforts were completed, the group handed over the facilities to the villagers and left. But Madiath and a small group of YSMD volunteers came to the realisation that the irrigation facilities benefited mostly the landlords, and decided to stay in Orissa to become social activists. Joe Madiath and remaining volunteers moved to Ganjam district at the invitation of the local authorities, and established Gram Vikas in 1979. Gram Vikas initially focused on social activism in support of adivasi communities who were being exploited by landlords and liquor merchants. Gram Vikas spearheaded a movement to organise adivasi communities to reclaim land, chase out moneylenders, and free themselves from bonded labor and alcoholism. Since its inception, Gram Vikas has worked on a variety of development issues, including biogas promotion, community forestry, rural habitat development, and education. Over the years, however, Gram Vikas have focused their efforts on mechanisms that ensure sustainable solutions for water and sanitation. Prior to founding Gram Vikas, Joe Madiath worked on a project in Cuttack district to build toilets for villagers. However, because the burden of carrying water from the nearby pump to the toilets befell the women of the village, they rejected the approach, and the villagers eventually reverted to unsanitary practices.[4] As a result, Gram Vikas decided to approach water and sanitation by first building solid partnerships with the villages, insisting on gender equality. Villagers are asked to contribute to a “corpus fund”, which is invested in an interest-earning deposit and used to pay the costs of families moving to the village.[5] Gram Vikas also require that all villagers, regardless of economic, social, or caste status, receive the same types of toilets and bathing rooms. Additionally, the entire community must be involved in the planning, construction, monitoring, and maintenance of the system. Finally, Gram Vikas promotes gender equality as an inherent part of their programs. By their own admission, the Gram Vikas approach is difficult to implement due to the requirements for 100% participation and community equity. However, Gram Vikas claims the solution leads to socially sustainable solutions, thus making it a “good but difficult model”. Gram Vikas also carries out programs on the subjects of community health, education, natural resource management and food security, as well as renewable energy.[6] As of March 2011, Gram Vikas has carried water and sanitation in 1089 villages in the states of Orissa, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, and Andhra Pradesh, for a total population of 298,000 individuals.[7]",Gram Vikas is an Indian non governmental organisation based in Orissa and founded in 1979 It uses common concerns for water and sanitation to unite and empower rural communities including adivasi communities Gram Vikas translates to village development both in Hindi and in Oriya the official language of Orissa In 1971 Joe Madiath led 400 volunteers from the University of Madras Young Students Movement for Development to West Bengal to manage relief camps for refugees of the Bangladesh Liberation War Witnessing the devastation of the 1971 Orissa cyclone and realising the comparatively little attention received by the disaster victims Madiath and a small group of 40 volunteers shifted their attention there The group decided that the best way to help the cyclone victims was to provide irrigation facilities Once these efforts were completed the group handed over the facilities to the villagers and left But Madiath and a small group of YSMD volunteers came to the realisation that the irrigation facilities benefited mostly the landlords and decided to stay in Orissa to become social activists Joe Madiath and remaining volunteers moved to Ganjam district at the invitation of the local authorities and established Gram Vikas in 1979 Gram Vikas initially focused on social activism in support of adivasi communities who were being exploited by landlords and liquor merchants Gram Vikas spearheaded a movement to organise adivasi communities to reclaim land chase out moneylenders and free themselves from bonded labor and alcoholism Since its inception Gram Vikas has worked on a variety of development issues including biogas promotion community forestry rural habitat development and education Over the years however Gram Vikas have focused their efforts on mechanisms that ensure sustainable solutions for water and sanitation Prior to founding Gram Vikas Joe Madiath worked on a project in Cuttack district to build toilets for villagers However because the burden of carrying water from the nearby pump to the toilets befell the women of the village they rejected the approach and the villagers eventually reverted to unsanitary practices As a result Gram Vikas decided to approach water and sanitation by first building solid partnerships with the villages insisting on gender equality Villagers are asked to contribute to a corpus fund which is invested in an interest earning deposit and used to pay the costs of families moving to the village Gram Vikas also require that all villagers regardless of economic social or caste status receive the same types of toilets and bathing rooms Additionally the entire community must be involved in the planning construction monitoring and maintenance of the system Finally Gram Vikas promotes gender equality as an inherent part of their programs By their own admission the Gram Vikas approach is difficult to implement due to the requirements for 100 participation and community equity However Gram Vikas claims the solution leads to socially sustainable solutions thus making it a good but difficult model Gram Vikas also carries out programs on the subjects of community health education natural resource management and food security as well as renewable energy As of March 2011 Gram Vikas has carried water and sanitation in 1089 villages in the states of Orissa Jharkhand Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh for a total population of 298 000 individuals
Greenvein,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenvein,"Greenvein is a Nonprofit organization in India for planting and protecting trees . Its vision is to reduce global warming and implement reforestation programs.[1][2] The motto of the organization is to propagate a culture of planting and protecting trees and make it part of our day to day activity rather than a ritualistic and symbolic process.[3] Greenvein's first meeting was held at Ernakulam on 6 May 2014. In this meeting a decision was made to plant and protect One Billion Trees across India within 21 years. . In order to fulfil the aim, widespread campaigns were initiated. Within a year Greenvein made its presence in Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Odisha. On June 5, 2014, World Environment Day, 32,200 saplings were planted in Kerala alone with the support of Ministry of Forest. On the same day saplings were planted in Dehradun, Capital city of Uttarakhand state, Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) Delhi, Redegg Infopark at Nagarcoil, Tamil Nadu , Niv Vidya Mandir at Greater Noida, and Navaprabhat Gurukulam , Navupauli village, Odisha. 2014, Greenvein started nurseries at Haridwar, Rudraprayag, Noida and Odisha with the help of common people. In Kerala, 10 nurseries were started. In addition to this, Greenvein volunteers maintain many more small nurseries with the capacity to rear 100 saplings to 300 saplings at their homes or surroundings. These nurseries produce approximately 300, 000 saplings per year. And in various states, Greenvein has planted 600, 000 saplings within 2015. On June 5, 2015, Greenvein conducted a seed distribution campaign and distributed approximately 150, 000 seeds on that day. The project is called one billion tree project.[4] Tree Trip [5] is a campaign in the leadership of Swami Samvidanand, Chief Coordinator of Greenvein to create awareness on the necessity of planting and protecting trees and to plant seeds and saplings in every single district of India . This "" Himalaya to Kanyakumari"" Tree Trip started from Himalaya on 7 May 2015.[6] Swami Samvidanand leads this journey in a Maruti Alto car.

Gujarat Vidhya Sabha,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Vidhya_Sabha,"Gujarat Vidya Sabha, originally called Gujarat Vernacular Society, is a literary institution for the promotion of vernacular Gujarati literature and education, and for the collection of manuscripts and printed books; located in the city of Ahmedabad, India. It was founded by a British administrator, Alexander Kinloch Forbes, in 1848 with the Gujarati author Dalpatram.[1][2] The name was changed on the occasion of the centenary of the institution. It published Gujarat's first newspaper, established the first Gujarati school for girls, the first library and the first Gujarati periodical.[1] Gujarat Vernacular Society was founded by British East India Company administrator, Alexander Kinloch Forbes on 26 December 1848 along with Dalpatram.[1] The fund of Rs 9601 was raised from locals, Baroda State and British officers.[3][4] The society had in 1877 a fund of £2791 (Rs. 27,910), of which £1000 (Rs. 10,000) were contributed by Premchand Raichand of Bombay. The first newspaper in Gujarat was started in Ahmedabad by this society. It was a weekly paper issued on Wednesday, Budhvar, and hence in Ahmedabad all newspapers were called Budhvariya during those times. The library, now included in the Hemabhai Institute, and the first girls' school in Ahmedabad, were established by the help of this society. Useful books were printed by it, and the publication of others was helped by money grants. It brought out a monthly magazine, Buddhiprakash, which in 1876 had a monthly sale of 1250 copies. The magazine is still published. The society helps libraries in all parts of Gujarat and Kathiawar, and gives prizes to schools. It undertakes to sell and distribute books, and offers annual prizes for essays on various useful subjects. A yearly prize of £15 (Rs. 150) is given for the best Gujarati essay on a given subject, the funds coming from an endowment of £250 (Rs. 2500) made in 1864 by a Bombay merchant, Sorabji Jamsedji Jijibai. Its library contained (1877) 1590 volumes in various languages. At the close of 1876 there were forty-eight life members, two yearly members, and two honorary members. Its yearly receipts amount to about £180 (Rs. 1800) and its expenditure to £129 (Rs. 1290).[5] The textile pioneer of Gujarat, Rao Bahadur Ranchhodlal Chhotalal, donated money to the Gujarat Vernacular Society to start a girls' high school, which was started in 1892 and was named RB Ranchhodlal Chhotalal Girls High School after the donor.[1] The society changed its name to Gujarat Vidya Sabha in 1946.[3] The Vidya Sabha is currently presided by the architect Balkrishna Doshi.[3]",Gujarat Vidya Sabha originally called Gujarat Vernacular Society is a literary institution for the promotion of vernacular Gujarati literature and education and for the collection of manuscripts and printed books located in the city of Ahmedabad India It was founded by a British administrator Alexander Kinloch Forbes in 1848 with the Gujarati author Dalpatram The name was changed on the occasion of the centenary of the institution It published Gujarat s first newspaper established the first Gujarati school for girls the first library and the first Gujarati periodical Gujarat Vernacular Society was founded by British East India Company administrator Alexander Kinloch Forbes on 26 December 1848 along with Dalpatram The fund of Rs 9601 was raised from locals Baroda State and British officers The society had in 1877 a fund of 2791 Rs 27 910 of which 1000 Rs 10 000 were contributed by Premchand Raichand of Bombay The first newspaper in Gujarat was started in Ahmedabad by this society It was a weekly paper issued on Wednesday Budhvar and hence in Ahmedabad all newspapers were called Budhvariya during those times The library now included in the Hemabhai Institute and the first girls school in Ahmedabad were established by the help of this society Useful books were printed by it and the publication of others was helped by money grants It brought out a monthly magazine Buddhiprakash which in 1876 had a monthly sale of 1250 copies The magazine is still published The society helps libraries in all parts of Gujarat and Kathiawar and gives prizes to schools It undertakes to sell and distribute books and offers annual prizes for essays on various useful subjects A yearly prize of 15 Rs 150 is given for the best Gujarati essay on a given subject the funds coming from an endowment of 250 Rs 2500 made in 1864 by a Bombay merchant Sorabji Jamsedji Jijibai Its library contained 1877 1590 volumes in various languages At the close of 1876 there were forty eight life members two yearly members and two honorary members Its yearly receipts amount to about 180 Rs 1800 and its expenditure to 129 Rs 1290 The textile pioneer of Gujarat Rao Bahadur Ranchhodlal Chhotalal donated money to the Gujarat Vernacular Society to start a girls high school which was started in 1892 and was named RB Ranchhodlal Chhotalal Girls High School after the donor The society changed its name to Gujarat Vidya Sabha in 1946 The Vidya Sabha is currently presided by the architect Balkrishna Doshi

Haji Public School,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haji_Public_School,"Haji Public School is a not-for-profit school established in 2009 by the Haji family in their ancestral village Breswana, in the Doda district of Jammu and Kashmir state in northern India.[1][2] Haji Public School began operations on 4 May 2009 from Breswana village, the ancestral home of its founding members, the Haji family. The school started with two classes, lower and upper kindergarten, two teachers and 35 students studying in rooms of the Haji Cottage. The school grows with them each year. Haji Public School has over 350 students on its rolls (December 2016), a permanent local staff of more than 20 teachers, and a running roster of dozens of Indian and international teaching volunteers.[3][4] Mr Saleem Haji of Breswana (Doda) moved to Dubai with his family in early '80s. As he moved to Dubai for work, he made sure that he brought his family back to Breswana every summer. His daughter, Sabbah Haji, was born and raised in Dubai. Thus she always carried her ancestral home with herself even though she was not to live there. Sabbah Haji then shifted to Bengaluru where she completed her Bachelors in Commerce and worked in many organizations as an editor, writer, team lead, liaison and content manager. In 2008, the Amarnath struggle of Jammu and Kashmir broke out. Sabbah Haji's mother, Tasneem Haji witnessed her hometown, Kishtwar, being severely affected during the struggle. It was then that Sabbah Haji, who was in Bengaluru, quit her city life to return to her family in Jammu and Kashmir.[4] After Sabbah Haji returned to her native village Breswana in 2008, she saw that nearly two generations of villagers had no education, due to the apathetic attitude of successive governments and militancy. At over 7500 feet, with no motorable access to the rest of the state, education in this mountain region has languished in the past few decades. Although government schools do exist in the area, Sabbah dismisses them as hopeless and inefficient, lacking faculties, teachers and turning out 'degree students who could not read'. Her family wanted to provide these children with an education that would allow them to compete on equal grounds with the rest of the world. And thus the Haji Public School was born in 2009.[2][5][6] The school was built on land donated by her family and was initially set up under the 'Haji Amina Charity Trust' in Doda, founded by Mr Nasir Haji. It now functions under the 'Haji Education Foundation', a separate organization set up in 2011 specifically to promote education in the region. The Haji Education Foundation trustees are Mohd Saleem Haji, Tasneem Haji and Sabbah Haji. The Trust is also funded by donations from various members of the family and friends. Since it started on 4 May 2009, the Haji Public School has just one objective – ""to impart knowledge to those children who cannot avail of the academic facilities being provided to others, in more accessible cities"". The cause was so strong that the village inhabitants helped build the school brick by brick. The villagers have brought up materials for the school on their backs. They wrote a petition which allowed the Haji family to start a school. Over the winter of 2008, Sabbah Haji and her mother, Tasneem Haji, trained two boys from the village in order to turn them into teachers. With no building to call their own initially, they worked out of two rooms in their ancestral house itself. They started at the ground level, teaching only the lower and upper kindergarten students. With Sabbah's strong and disciplined work ethic from Bengaluru and Tasneem's crucial 30 years’ worth teaching and school administration experience, they began the Haji Public School with about 25 kids. Today, the school has its own building and it is growing every year. The school now has over 350 students. The school has expanded its branches further in nearest villages such as Persholla and Shadiwan.[4][5][7] By setting up good schools in the region, the Haji family intends simply ""to make education accessible to the inaccessible"". The idea of good schooling will open up a new world to the students, will give them a foot in the door, provide them with opportunities previously denied to them, help them in achieving whatever desires and goals they may have for the future. The school aims to provide quality education to a village that hasn’t seen it in over 30 years.[5][8] Mr Nasir Haji is the main driving force and primary funder of the entire project from its inception to date. It was Nasir Haji's vision of bringing about long-lasting change through education in his ancestral village that gave birth to the idea for Haji Public School in 2008.[7][9] Known as the ""Rural-Rockstar"" and ""Haji-Baji"", Sabbah Haji is the Director of Haji Public School. She belongs to the latest generation of Hajis to live and work in the village. She was born and raised in Dubai, UAE, did her college and worked in the online writing/editing space in Bangalore for almost a decade before moving back to Jammu and Kashmir in 2008. She has been involved with running the school since its inception. Sabbah's functions at the school apart from regular teaching, are maintaining the accounts, material management, supervising and training staff, acquiring and looking after volunteers, and liaising and communications for Haji Public School particularly online and through social media. She runs the school Facebook and Tumblr and Tweets incessantly in her personal capacity as @imsabbah. Her personal relationship with the villagers and particularly the students helps in keeping the energy and motivation behind the school going.[7][8][9][10] Saleem Haji is the Chief Advisor for Haji Public School, and elected Sarpanch (Village Headman) of Breswana. He is indispensable to the functioning of the school, overseeing construction, maintenance, material movement and liaising with the authorities, local government and local villagers. A respected elder of the village and community, Saleem Haji has very good relations with officials in the local government and education department which facilitates the smooth operations of the school.[11] Tasneem Haji has been the Principal of Haji Public School since its inception in 2009. She is the guiding force behind Haji Public School's functioning and ensures the school runs like a well-oiled machine, organised and in shipshape. Her personal connect and relationship with the villagers, particularly the women, is an added advantage in her role as Principal of the school.[11] Noah Haji is an Advisor with Haji Public School. He has been involved with the school from the inception and has helped drive the vision and strategy forward. Babur Majid is the Technical Director and Board Member of Haji Public School. Based out US, Babur helps School Management with various initiatives and projects. Haji Public School is located in a tiny village, Breswana, of Doda district in Jammu and Kashmir. Breswana lies in the mountains of Doda District spread out at an altitude of 7,200-7,500 ft. It is about a 7 km hike from the nearest cross-over bridge over the river Chenab in the rustic town of Premnagar. The setting is scenic, with huge grassy mountains, ponies and white frothy rivers. Arriving there from Jammu city takes a full day, in two stages as follows: Apart from the few regular teaching staff, the school relies heavily on the volunteers coming in from all around the world to teach the kids. The local staff members are capable of teaching till the 2nd grade only. Thus the higher classes require more qualified hands to take care of the children. The school has teaching staff of over 20, including full-time, local teachers as well as long term Indian and international teaching volunteers. The volunteers, who live among the villagers, teach for a period of three months. They spend time with students and make their efforts to erase negative impressions of outsiders through their selfless efforts, hard work, and dedication. The volunteers are not paid, but they are provided with food and lodging. The first long term volunteers were two young men, Felix Sebastian[12] and Azon Linhares,[13] who stayed over three months each. Azon subsequently joined Haji Public School as a permanent member and was Deputy Director of School Operations for three years. Till December 2016, Haji Public School has had over 62 teaching volunteers from Canada, Singapore, the US, South Africa, France and India. Several of them have returned for multiple long-term stints with Haji Public School since they find themselves invested in and attached to the students and the work to be genuinely satisfying.[4][5][9][14] The school language of Instruction is English. The school asks for a nominal amount as fees. According to the school authority, this has been done deliberately to ensure that parents of the kids feel a sense of entitlement towards the school. Since it is an extremely poverty-stricken area, on the recommendation of Saleem Haji, who knows each and every family in the village, about 33% of the families who cannot afford the fee are provided with free education. They also have a rule which states that if there are 3 siblings in a family, the girl sibling will receive free education. If there is no girl child, then the youngest boy receives free education.[2][9] '&TV's family game show Deal Ya No Deal saw a special moment when Sabbah Haji participated in the show to win the money and use it to improve the infrastructure of her school. Among the 25 contestants that participated from Kashmir to encourage her motive, were Kashmiri folk actor and director, Amir Bashir and Twitter India Head, Raheel Khursheed.  The show also witnessed the presence of the renowned author of The Reluctant Detective and Once upon a Crush - Kiran Manral.[16] Sabbah Haji uses her and her family's personal contacts and also actively promotes her school on social networking sites such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and through blogs/school website to attract not just volunteers but also donations in cash and kind. She used Twitter to raise awareness of the existence of her school by sharing pictures and videos, which led to an influx of volunteers and even necessary equipment from across the world. Sabbah Haji updates daily happenings about the school and her village on ""That School In The Village"" and ""Vice Village"". Sabbah Haji represents the school outside, on social media and at various conferences. At CONVERGE 2016, YKA's flagship event, Haji shared her powerful story through a series of photos of breaking barriers and starting change to an audience of over 1500 people.[17] Not only the kids at Haji Public School able to speak fluent English, but they are also ardent followers of Lord of The Rings, sports and even English music. One of the greatest changes Sabbah has seen in the kids has been the rise in their confidence levels.[1] The school is also expanding now. With their main branch in Breswana, they have built two more branches in the nearby villages, Persholla and Shadiwan. Although the school rests entirely on Nasir Haji's fund now, it is desperately trying to come up with a sustainable model which can keep the school running for years to come. Not only are they aiming to expand till the 12th grade, they also want to set up a college. They already have a land on which they wish to set up such an institution. HPS is hoping to get more and more volunteers and is even willing to pay teachers a salary if they wish to work full-time. They ask people who have a desire to teach, to come and explore, and help the children.[6][9]",Haji Public School is a not for profit school established in 2009 by the Haji family in their ancestral

Harijan Sevak Sangh,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harijan_Sevak_Sangh,"Harijan Sevak Sangh is a non-profit organisation founded by Mahatma Gandhi in 1932 to eradicate untouchability in India, working for Harijan or Dalit people and upliftment of scheduled castes of India.[1] It is headquartered at Kingsway Camp in Delhi, with branches in 26 states across India.[2] After the Second Round Table Conference, British government agreed to give Communal Award to the depressed classes on the request of B. R. Ambedkar. Gandhi opposed the government's decision which he considered it would divide the Hindu society and subsequently went on to the indefinite fast in Yerwada Jail. He ended his fast after signed Poona Pact with Ambedkar on 25 September 1932. On 30 September, Gandhi founded All India Anti Untouchability League, to remove untouchability in the society, which later renamed as Harijan Sevak Sangh (""Servants of Untouchables Society"").[3] At the time industrialist Ghanshyam Das Birla was its founding president with Amritlal Takkar as its Secretary.[4] The Sangh is headquartered at Kingsway Camp in Delhi. It was Valmiki Bhawan within the campus, which functioned as Gandhiji's one-room ashram,  Kasturba Gandhi and their children stayed at the nearby Kasturba Kutir, between April 1946 and June 1947, before he moved to Birla House. Today, the 20-acre campus includes the Gandhi ashram, Harijan Basti, Lala Hans Raj Gupta Industrial Training Institute and also has a residential school for boys and girls.[5][6] Its headquarter Gandhi Ashram, Kingsway Camp is listed as Gandhian Heritage Site by the Ministry of Culture, Govt. of India.

HelpAge India,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HelpAge_India,"HelpAge India is an Indian organization focused on the concerns of elders. Established in 1978, its mission is “to work for the cause and care of disadvantaged older persons and to improve their quality of life”. HelpAge advocates for their needs such as, for Universal Pension, quality healthcare, action against Elder Abuse and many more at the national, state and societal level, with the Central and State governments. It runs various Agecare programs to service elder needs. The aim is to serve disadvantaged elders in a holistic manner, enabling them to live active, dignified and healthier lives.[1][2] HelpAge India began in the late 1960s when the speaker of the Lok Sabha visited his counterpart in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, who was also honorary secretary of Help the Aged. He came back with a vision of setting up something similar in India. But it took seven years for this vision to take shape. In March 1974, when Jackson Cole, founder of HelpAge International visited India, Samson Daniel, a philanthropist, approached him for financial help to set up a member organisation in Delhi. Cole instead offered to train him to raise funds. After a three-month training course in London, Daniel and his wife returned to India and organised a sponsored walk with schoolchildren in Delhi. It was so successful that in 1975 HelpAge International recruited more staff to cover Bombay, Madras and Calcutta. HelpAge India is one of the founding members of HelpAge International,[3] a high-profile body having 97 member countries representing the cause of the elderly at the United Nations. It is closely associated with Help the Aged, UK[4] and has received a special testimonial from the United Nations for ""Dedicated service in support of the United Nations Programme on Ageing"".[5]
HelpAge India is also a full member of the International Federation on Ageing.[6] In April 1978, HelpAge India was registered in Delhi. Within three months it became autonomous as financial support ceased from UK. Soon after, in July, the society was awarded Certificates of Exemption under Sections 12A and 80G of the Income Tax Act, 1961, thus indicating general confidence in the society's affairs.[7] HelpAge India works in the following areas:[8] HelpAge India runs various programs servicing the needs of disadvantaged elderly mentioned here below: Mobile Healthcare Units (MHU): This program seeks to provide sustainable healthcare solutions to elders and their communities. The core of the program is a sponsored Mobile Healthcare Unit (MHU). This Unit provides primary healthcare to the needy elderly, while simultaneously educates the community on preventive healthcare. Each MHU has a doctor, pharmacist and a social worker. There are more than 159 Mobile Healthcare Units working in 24 states, providing 2.9 million free treatments. Restoration of Vision: In India 62% elderly suffer from cataract blindness. Credible and competent eye hospitals are selected for carrying out surgeries with HelpAge India's support. All surgeries are performed only in base hospitals and not in makeshift camps. Since 1980, this program has benefitted more than 9 lakh elders, restoring their sight & dignity. Cancer and Palliative Care: Cancer treatment in our country is highly priced and majority of elders are not covered by any form of medical insurance. HelpAge India provides palliative care to end- stage cancer patients, in partnership with a number of credible and competent cancer hospitals and organisations. Over 99,000 treatments have been supported since 1998. Geriatric Physiotherapy: Under this program, elders with musculoskeletal diseases such as back pain, arthritis, paralysis and other age related mobility challenges are treated. The aim is to enable elder mobility levels and make daily living easier. The services are provided through stationary physiotherapy clinics and mobile services, to elders living in remote communities and homes for the aged. Support a Gran: There are thousands of destitute elders who have no one to look after their basic needs and require support & help to sustain their day-to-day living. Over the years HelpAge India has enabled more than 30,000 destitute elders, by providing them regular supplies of food rations, clothing, basic healthcare and some pocket money, so they can live a life of dignity. Elder Helplines: 1800-180-1253: HelpAge runs toll-free Elder Helplines across 21 states in India offering assistance to older persons in need of emergency care and protection. The services offered are - rescue of abandoned elders, counselling those in distress, legal support, information related to services available etc.  HelpAge has also launched the 'HelpAge SOS' App to ensure help is just a click away. Old Age Homes/Day Care Centres: A roof over their heads is the critical need of the destitute elder, sick and often abandoned by family. HelpAge India has established model homes for the aged in places such as Patiala & Gurdaspur in Punjab, Cuddalore in Tamil Nadu and Kolkata in West Bengal. Besides these, HelpAge has also supported over 60 old age homes across India. Livelihood Support: Elders struggling to survive, especially in rural India, live lonely and impoverished lives. HelpAge organizes them into sustainable Elder-Self-Help-Groups (ESHGs) so they can pool their resources and support each other in times of need. Once the group is formed, the elders choose a viable livelihood activity that can generate income as well. These ESHGs are then federated into higher level community institutions so that they gain additional robustness. This model of HelpAge India has been adopted by the Ministry of Rural Development. Student Action for Value Education (SAVE) - To address the increasing gap between generations and sensitize the young towards elders, HelpAge works hand-in-hand with schools across the country to inculcate values of care, love and respect towards the elderly, in young students so they grow to become responsible and caring individuals and are sensitive to the needs of the older generation. Digital Literacy for Elders: The increasing pace of change in technology often excludes elders from the mainstream social fabric. To tackle this, HelpAge has started an easy 'Digital Literacy' program introducing elders to the online world. Partner institutions, organizations and volunteers are encouraged to conduct basic tutorials for elders, using the HelpAge Handbook for senior citizens – Computers and Smart Phones learning made easy. AdvantAge Card program: This benefit card offers discounts to senior citizens from Retail Associates on various products, services, and facilities ranging from health and wellness to holiday homes. Currently, there are 1.75 lakh members across 400 towns, in 23 states, being offered discounts by more than 8000 retail outlets across India.

India Photo Archive Foundation,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Photo_Archive_Foundation,"The India Photo Archive Foundation is a Public Charitable Trust engaged in digitising, annotating, and preserving photographic archives.[1] This came out as a result of Aditya Arya Archive by Aditya Arya, a photographer in India. The Foundation has been active since 2009.[2] The aim of the Foundation is preservation of photographic data for use of future generations. The idea is to preserve the original as well as create a digital version of negatives and prints so that a visual history database can be created. This is to enable the discourse on history to be extended to a larger population as the medium is visual rather than literal. The Foundation uses exhibitions, publications and the internet as media to share the works of the archives it has access to.[3][4] The Foundation has a Vintage Camera Museum next to the office of Aditya Arya.[5] The museum showcases cameras and other photography material all the way from the late 1800s.

Indiability Foundation,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiability_Foundation,"Indiability Foundation is an international non-governmental organization dedicated to improving the lives, opportunities, and human rights of people with physical disabilities in India. The Foundation delivers a variety of projects to youth and people living in the Thar Desert region of Western Rajasthan. The initiatives aim to promote the value of education, health, and gender, to enhance the social inclusion of disabled citizens into mainstream communities.[4] Indiability is a sister charity to SKSN (Sucheta Kriplani Shiksha Niketan)[5] – a school with over 20 years experience in providing education to the disabled in India.[6] The partnership enables Indiability to help promote and share SKSN's learnings in the field of disability at an international level, and improve the lives of physically disabled youth across India. The foundation is a very caring place. The flagship project, Indian Mixed Ability Group Events (IMAGE), operates in partnership with the Laureus Sport For Good Foundation, and uses sport as a social vaccine to create Disability Confidence between disabled and non-disabled Indian society.[1][7] The past decade has seen IMAGE progress from an after-school club to a community outreach program. The initiative started in 2005, when IMAGE was piloted at SKSN Institute with 195 of its disabled 8-12 year olds and 195 non-disabled 8-12 year olds from local schools of various socio-economic backgrounds.  Over the next 6 years, 18 IMAGE clubs sprang up around Rajasthan, totalling 1200 members.[4] Laureus World Sports Academy members, Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, Britain’s greatest ever paralympic athlete, and Kapil Dev, former captain of the Indian cricket team, visited the IMAGE project in 2010. During the visit, Baroness Grey-Thompson commented: ""It was important to have Kapil [Dev] here, he's such a famous person in India...If you are well-known, you have a chance to change people's attitude... We need more such events. If people see disabled kids play, they start thinking: 'If they can play, they can do other things as well. Why can't they work? They don't have to be burden on family.' This is what we want."" [8] In 2012, IMAGE evolved to the community level to reach the adult population more directly, provide a platform for 15- to 18-year-old IMAGE members to establish themselves as leaders, and empower those with disabilities in particular, to give back to their communities. The IMAGE Community sessions are currently conducted in 5 villages. IMAGE members, with and without disabilities, deliver a sport and play-based curriculum side-by-side, conveying important messages on hand washing, sanitation, education, gender equality, and disability awareness. Over time many of the IMAGE members become role models to the village children. When the communities see that disabled and non-disabled youth can work together, to deliver enjoyable and educational activities, it challenges their own negative stereotypes, towards disability.[9][10] In September 2015, Indiability’s IMAGE volunteers won the ‘Leader in Volunteer Engagement’ award, at the iVolunteer Awards held in Bandra, Mumbai. The award came as recognition for the impact they have achieved in the field of social development in 2014.[11][12][13][14] Rahul Mahajan, a guest speaker at the iVolunteer Awards, commented via social media, “When differently abled people can do this why can’t we?”[15] The iVolunteer Awards[16] were set up to recognise, reward, and promote the work of individuals and organisations that use volunteerism for the betterment of society.",Indiability Foundation is an international non governmental organization dedicated to improving the lives opportunities and human rights of people with physical disabilities in India The Foundation delivers a variety of projects to youth and people living in the Thar Desert region of Western Rajasthan The initiatives aim to promote the value of education health and gender to enhance the social inclusion of disabled citizens into mainstream communities Indiability is a sister charity to SKSN Sucheta Kriplani Shiksha Niketan a school with over 20 years experience in providing education to the disabled in India The partnership enables Indiability to help promote and share SKSN s learnings in the field of disability at an international level and improve the lives of physically disabled youth across India The foundation is a very caring place The flagship project Indian Mixed Ability Group Events IMAGE operates in partnership with the Laureus Sport For Good Foundation and uses sport as a social vaccine to create Disability Confidence between disabled and non disabled Indian society The past decade has seen IMAGE progress from an after school club to a community outreach program The initiative started in 2005 when IMAGE was piloted at SKSN Institute with 195 of its disabled 8 12 year olds and 195 non disabled 8 12 year olds from local schools of various socio economic backgrounds Over the next 6 years 18 IMAGE clubs sprang up around Rajasthan totalling 1200 members Laureus World Sports Academy members Baroness Tanni Grey Thompson Britain s greatest ever paralympic athlete and Kapil Dev former captain of the Indian cricket team visited the IMAGE project in 2010 During the visit Baroness Grey Thompson commented It was important to have Kapil Dev here he s such a famous person in India If you are well known you have a chance to change people s attitude We need more such events If people see disabled kids play they start thinking If they can play they can do other things as well Why can t they work They don t have to be burden on family This is what we want In 2012 IMAGE evolved to the community level to reach the adult population more directly provide a platform for 15 to 18 year old IMAGE members to establish themselves as leaders and empower those with disabilities in particular to give back to their communities The IMAGE Community sessions are currently conducted in 5 villages IMAGE members with and without disabilities deliver a sport and play based curriculum side by side conveying important messages on hand washing sanitation education gender equality and disability awareness Over time many of the IMAGE members become role models to the village children When the communities see that disabled and non disabled youth can work together to deliver enjoyable and educational activities it challenges their own negative stereotypes towards disability In September 2015 Indiability s IMAGE volunteers won the Leader in Volunteer Engagement award at the iVolunteer Awards held in Bandra Mumbai The award came as recognition for the impact they have achieved in the field of social development in 2014 Rahul Mahajan a guest speaker at the iVolunteer Awards commented via social media When differently abled people can do this why can t we The iVolunteer Awards were set up to recognise reward and promote the work of individuals and organisations that use volunteerism for the betterment of society

Following on the premise laid out in the rationale for the overall objective, the project is built on the belief that the market forces, which have in many cases excluded the needs of poor farmers and handicrafts artisans, can actually be harnessed to create inclusive growth and environmentally sustainable production by creating consumer demand for sustainably produced, fair trade products. By implementing a strategic marketing plan that includes events, targeted consumer outreach, and creative promotions, alongside a distribution strategy to make fair trade products easily available to consumers.

Kannada Sahitya Parishat,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada_Sahitya_Parishat,"Kannada Saahithya Parishath (Kannada: Kannaḍa Sāhitya Pariṣattu) (Kannada Literary Council) is an Indian non-profit organisation that promotes the Kannada language. Its headquarters is in the city of Bengaluru in the state of Karnataka, India. It strives to promote Kannada language through publishing books, organising literary seminars and promoting research projects. It also organises an annual conference on Kannada literature called Kannada Sahithya Sammelana(Kannada Literary Meet). The current president of the parishat is Manu Baligar. During the British rule of India, Kannada speakers were spread across different provinces. Coming under the influence of different languages in those provinces, the pronunciation and grammar of Kannada language started to differ across provinces. This led to a gap in communication across the people in these provinces though they spoke the same language of Kannada.[4] Mokshagundam Vishweshwaraiah, who was the Diwan of the Mysore Kingdom felt the need to conserve and promote the Kannada language and literature. In this direction, he started the Mysore Economic Conference and created a study circle under H. V. Nanjundaiah. A sub-committee formed under the study circle came up with five different topics on which suggestions were invited:[4] The sub-committee received good responses from the public and it decided to organise a conference in Bangalore on 3 May 1915 to act upon these suggestions. The conference was held on the grounds of the Government High School and was attended by littérateurs, newspaper editors and other dignitaries from different regions. The conference agreed to create the Karnataka Sahitya Parishat with a mandate to conserve and promote Kannada language and literature. H. V. Nanjundaiah was unanimously elected as the President of the Parishat.[4] Apart from the Mysore province, the Karnataka Sahitya Parishat was simultaneously started in the Madras, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Kodagu provinces. H. V. Nanjundaiah remained as President of the Parishat for the first five years of its creation. In 1935, an annual event under the aegis of the Parishat called as Kannada Sahitya Sammelana commenced. The foundation ceremony of a separate building to house the Parishat was organised on 12 April 1937 under the Presidency of Karpura Srinivas Rao. The construction of this building was completed on 29 May 1938. B M Srikantaiah was the Vice President of the Parishat from 1938 till 1942. In 1938, the name of Karnataka Sahitya Parishat was changed to Kannada Sahitya Parishat. Under the guidance of B M Srikantaiah, the logo of the Parishat containing the map of the Mysore province with the phrase Sirigannadam gelge, Kannada Sahitya Parishat written inside it was created.[4] Over the period of time; a women's wing, a publishing house, a Kannada journal and literature exams were also added to the repertoire of the Parishat. Kannada Sahitya Parishat branches at the district and taluk levels were also created. A new building is being constructed to replace the existing building of the Parishat at a cost of Rupees five crores.[5] During its existence, the Parishat has contributed to the growth of Kannada language by organising conferences and debates, publication and release of books, organising talks by eminent writers and also by holding the annual Kannada Sahitya Sammelana. The Parishat has reportedly lost focus on its goals due to various reasons including lack of funds and political interference.[6] There were also reports of irregularities conducted within the Parishat in 1987, which prompted the Karnataka Government to nominate an Administrator to the Parishat. The office of the Administrator was removed in 1989.[4] Kannada Sahitya Parishat literally mean Kannada Literary Council",Kannada Saahithya Parishath Kannada Kanna a S hitya Pari attu Kannada Literary Council is an Indian non profit organisation that promotes the Kannada language Its headquarters is in the city of Bengaluru in the state of Karnataka India It strives to promote Kannada language through publishing books organising literary seminars and promoting research projects It also organises an annual conference on Kannada literature called Kannada Sahithya Sammelana Kannada Literary Meet The current president of the parishat is Manu Baligar During the British rule of India Kannada speakers were spread across different provinces Coming under the influence of different languages in those provinces the pronunciation and grammar of Kannada language started to differ across provinces This led to a gap in communication across the people in these provinces though they spoke the same language of Kannada Mokshagundam Vishweshwaraiah who was the Diwan of the Mysore Kingdom felt the need to conserve and promote the Kannada language and literature In this direction he started the Mysore Economic Conference and created a study circle under H V Nanjundaiah A sub committee formed under the study circle came up with five different topics on which suggestions were invited The sub committee received good responses from the public and it decided to organise a conference in Bangalore on 3 May 1915 to act upon these suggestions The conference was held on the grounds of the Government High School and was attended by litt rateurs newspaper editors and other dignitaries from different regions The conference agreed to create the Karnataka Sahitya Parishat with a mandate to conserve and promote Kannada language and literature H V Nanjundaiah was unanimously elected as the President of the Parishat Apart from the Mysore province the Karnataka Sahitya Parishat was simultaneously started in the Madras Mumbai Hyderabad and Kodagu provinces H V Nanjundaiah remained as President of the Parishat for the first five years of its creation In 1935 an annual event under the aegis of the Parishat called as Kannada Sahitya Sammelana commenced The foundation ceremony of a separate building to house the Parishat was organised on 12 April 1937 under the Presidency of Karpura Srinivas Rao The construction of this building was completed on 29 May 1938 B M Srikantaiah was the Vice President of the Parishat from 1938 till 1942 In 1938 the name of Karnataka Sahitya Parishat was changed to Kannada Sahitya Parishat Under the guidance of B M Srikantaiah the logo of the Parishat containing the map of the Mysore province with the phrase Sirigannadam gelge Kannada Sahitya Parishat written inside it was created Over the period of time a women s wing a publishing house a Kannada journal and literature exams were also added to the repertoire of the Parishat Kannada Sahitya Parishat branches at the district and taluk levels were also created A new building is being constructed to replace the existing building of the Parishat at a cost of Rupees five crores During its existence the Parishat has contributed to the growth of Kannada language by organising conferences and debates publication and release of books organising talks by eminent writers and also by holding the annual Kannada Sahitya Sammelana The Parishat has reportedly lost focus on its goals due to various reasons including lack of funds and political interference There were also reports of irregularities conducted within the Parishat in 1987 which prompted the Karnataka Government to nominate an Administrator to the Parishat The office of the Administrator was removed in 1989 Kannada Sahitya Parishat literally mean Kannada Literary Council

Kerala Sasthra Sahithya Parishad,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala_Sasthra_Sahithya_Parishad,"Kerala Sastra Sahitya Parishad (KSSP) (meaning: Kerala Science Literature Movement) is a leftist outfit in the state of Kerala, India. It was conceived as a people's science movement.[1] At the time of its founding in 1962 it was a 40-member group consisting of science writers and teachers with an interest in science from a social perspective. Over the past four decades its membership has grown to over 60,000 individuals, in more than 2,300 units spread all over Kerala.[2] In 1996, the group received the Right Livelihood Award ""for its major contribution to a model of development rooted in social justice and popular participation."" The original objective at the time of the founding of Kerala Sasthra Sahithya Parishad (KSSP) was limited to publishing scientific literature in Malayalam, the local language, and popularizing science. However it was soon realized that publication and giving lessons alone were not enough to popularize science and extend its benefits to the common people[citation needed]. KSSP held that a privileged minority was monopolizing the benefits of science and technology and its results for their own profit at the expense of the majority[citation needed]. KSSP chose as its mission, the challenge of arming people with the tools of science and technology so that they can reverse this process. Thus in 1974, KSSP decided to become a people's science movement and adopted ""science for social revolution"" as its motto.[3]
Over the past four decades it has grown into a large people's science movement with a membership of about 60,000, drawn from all walks of life, and distributed in about 2,300 units within the state of Kerala. Over the years, it has also expanded its fields of interest and activities to almost all fields of human endeavor[citation needed]. The KSSP is involved, broadly in three types of activities: education, agitatative (sic), and constructive(sic), in areas like environment, health, education, energy, literacy, micro planning and development in general.[3] Presently A.P. Muraleedharan is the president and K.Radhan is the general secretary. Intellectuals such as M. K. Prasad, R. V. G. Menon, Kavumbayi Balakrishnan, B. Ekbal, K. Pappooty, M. P. Parameswaran, Kunhikkannan TP, etc. have been past presidents of the organization[citation needed]. KSSP publishes two monthly magazines, Sastrakeralam (for secondary school students) and Sastragathi, and a biweekly, Eureka[4] (for primary school students) and also a newsletter Parishad Vartha. Eureka and Sastrakeralam are intended for children and the newsletter for members. Sastragathi is the organization's main magazine. Also KSSP's major contribution is in publishing science books in Malayalam with more than 700 titles already published. One of the latest books published is  Jeevarekha  by Dr.M.P.Parameswaran. In addition, KSSP has already published hundreds of small booklets, related to different issues. LUCA is the online science portal of KSSP. In 2004, KSSP conducted a survey of the living conditions in Kerala. The survey was titled Kerala Padanam-Keralam engane jeevikkunnu Keralam Engane Chinthikkunnu, translated as The Kerala Study-How Does Kerala Live? How Does Kerala Think?. It covered about 6000 households in the state. The activists spent hours with each family to understand their lifestyle and thoughts. The findings follow. The population of Kerala has been divided into four classes or groups. Around 40% of the people are very poor, and only a minority of about 10% of the people belong to the upper middle class and control their state of affairs.[5] More and more people are moving towards extreme poverty and the rich minority are growing their wealth. The findings have been published in a book with the same title as the survey Kerala Padanam-Keralam engane jeevikkunnu Keralam Engane Chinthikkunnu.[6][7][8] The KSSP has developed a number of self-reliant products and has been marketing them though its units and the local offices of the Parishad Production Centre and the Samata Production Center which are attached to district KSSP offices.[9] Hot box is an energy efficient therrmocol box which keeps the temperature constant for hours, saving energy and fuel. It is ideal for rice cooking and for keeping normal food items hot. Rice is cooked in boiled water. The boiling point of water is 100 °C (212 °F) and will not increase with further heating. When rice is cooked normally, the fire is maintained until it is cooked. If the water temperature can be maintained at 100 °C (212 °F) without further heating, fuel is saved. This is what the Hot Box is designed to do. Rice is cooked in water until it has boild and the bowl is put in the Hotbox until it is fully cooked.[9] IRTC, the research wing of KSSP has launched yet another product , the Portable biogas plant. This helps with the proper disposal of waste and conserves energy.

He was awarded by  Padma Vibhushan,[4] in the year 1954. KSWA was started BY Mr. B. G. Kher with the aim of improving the living conditions of the 100 odd families who had settled in the marshes of Bandra East. In the year 1998 Mr. Kishor Kher and Mrs. Mrinalini Kher took over the KSWA's operational activities. KSWA started the Yuva Parivartan movement. This movement was started to guide the unmotivated school dropouts and to become economically independent by imparting livelihood skills to them.

Kunpan Cultural School,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunpan_Cultural_School,"The Kunpan Cultural School, provided by the Swiss-Tibetan foundation ES Tibet, is located in Dharamshala in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. In 2000 no institution existed that could provide young Tibetans refugees in India any further education except the basic scholar edition given by the Tibetan Transit School (T.T.S.). The Tibetan Exile Government in Dharamshala had already established educational support by setting up the T.T.S. in which newly arrived Tibetan refugees are educated for five years.[1] Having had the idea of setting up an educational organisation, but not having any practical experience, the project Educational Support Tibet (ES Tibet) started in October 2000 in Delhi with five students (four boys and one girl) who were leaving the TTS. The startup school was registered as a National Open School, to get either the 8th or 10th grade normal school qualification in India. At the beginning of 2002, courses for twenty female and male students in Whitefield, Bangalore, started in a building that had rooms enough to provide living quarters and classrooms. That first class finished in the summer of 2004, followed by a second group of twenty students that finished their studies in August 2006. Since the middle of 2006, the Kunpan Cultural School has been located in Dharamshala, the seat of the exile Tibetan Government and centre of the Tibetan diaspora in India. Jigme Lhundup Rinpoche, the former speaker and minister of the Central Tibetan Administration, had been an important supporter of ES Tibet, and had contributed immensely toward overall development of Kunpan Cultural School. With his unmeasurable effort and clear vision had brought many supporters and great results both to students’ achievement and organisation development as whole. Supported by Jigme Lhundup Rinpoche, in June 2010 the board members of Kunpan Cultural School had the privilege of privately meeting the 14th Dalai Lama at his residence in Dharamsala. He acknowledged and appreciated the successful work that Kunpan have been doing for the previous ten years in terms of educating Tibetan refugees in India. He also encouraged the board members at least keep up the good work for another ten years. Knowing that the school didn't have an official name at that time as it uses ES Tibet, HH 14th Dalai Lama vested the name Kunpan Cultural School – Kunpan is a Tibetan word, meaning beneficial to all.[2] Living too far away from schools, Tibetans who grow up in the rural areas of Tibet often have no possibility to attend a basic scholar education. In addition, fees for the Chinese state schools are so high that Tibetan families very often cannot afford it. To avoid the sad fate of an uneducated person or an analphabet, every year more than 4000 young Tibetans (aged 18 to 30) to refuge to Northern India where a large Tibetan diaspora is living.[3] Selected T.T.S students are educated for a further two years in English, computer skills and Chinese. These subjects were identified as key elements for professional success once the students will be back in Tibet.[1] The Kunpan Cultural School promotes the independency of Tibetans with professional and personal training and thus makes an important contribution to the preservation and development of the traditional Tibetan culture. Within 2.5 years the students earn educational basics to aa level which corresponds with the 10th grade in India public schools. This level of general education will significantly enhance the students chances, to live their lives free and independent from the refugees center, in order to find their place in the society, and back at home in Tibet, to find themselves a job.[3] Main subjects of the school are lessons in English and Chinese and computer skills, supported by additional workshops in mathematics, bookkeeping and Tibetan and Western philosophy. The professional training may permit the students to learn commercial and technical professions as well as nursing, education or home economics; but also professions in Information Technology sector.[3][4] The school has been run by Tibetans themselves, and beside the Tibetan manager and the permanently employed Tibetan teachers, there are always Volunteers from Western countries. The students live in a flat-sharing community and organise their cohabit by themselves.[5][6][7][8] The current group of 24 students at the Kunpan Cultural School started their two years of study in July 2013 and have finished in June 2015. Among others, the'll absolve the Cambridge University Preliminary English Test (PET) and the First Certificate in English (FCE) examinations. For example, the curriculum of English lessons progresses from beginners’ level, using the Cambridge University English Tests, from Key English Test (KET), Preliminary English Test (PET), First Certificate in English (FCE) and Certificate of Advanced English (CAE). In the last fourteen years, about 130 students at Kunpan Cultural School have passed the KET examinations,[1] and in all about 200 students attended Kunpan Cultural School.[2] Since most of the students will be going back to Tibet, the students learn Chinese at least at a level of everyday Chinese, which is essential for them to get a job back in their native land. The computing education includes computer fundamentals, Microsoft Office, web design, book publishing, Adobe CS4, Internet and Windows skils, hardware, network troubleshooting and configuration.[1] 80% of the students who have completed their studies at Kunpan Cultural School have returned to Tibet and all of them have found employment there, some are self-employed, English teachers, tourist guides, some are working as translators in NGO's in Tibet and some are doing further education in China. One of the former students set up a school and two others started their own travel agency.[1] As there are always more applicants for places than the school was able to provide, it is planned to expand the school localities to host 40 students, thus the financial situation is unsure. The ES Tibet foundation strives towards donations and adaptations for Tibetan students of an age between 18 and 30 years.[9] In 2012 a new building was inaugurated. The 6th group of students graduated in June/July 2015, and the 7th group started their time at the Kunpan Cultural School in July 2015. Out of group of little more than 40 people, now 14 young men and 10 young women form the 2015/17 group of students,[2] although there were not enough  sponsors in Switzerland to support all of

MissingGirls,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MissingGirls,"MISSING is a public awareness campaign which aims to sensitize people to the plight of millions of girls who are trafficked for sexual exploitation. MISSING is a four-part public awareness campaign. It tackles the first P of the United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking four P strategy on anti-trafficking, prevention through advocacy and awareness.[1] MISSING's work in rural Bengal has helped save girls from sexual exploitation and rehabilitate them. MISSING: Game for a Cause won NASSCOM's Indie Game of The Year Award. MISSING raises awareness amongst the populace of the millions of girls who are being trafficked into prostitution and bring this issue out of the closet by engaging and educating the public on the crime, and the damage it inflicts on its victims. MISSING makes the masses aware of the consequences of their actions, be it on the Internet or physical, which creates a demand for girls.[2] MISSING creates awareness that translates into action taken by the government and the public. Awareness is essential in preventing this crime and is key to beating traffickers. During Leena's career as a photographer, she was hit by a very important issue – sex trafficking. Today, there are 3 million women in prostitution in India, out of which 1.2 million are young girls. The average age of recruitment of girls into prostitution is between 9 and 12 years of age.[2] These are disturbing statistics. When Leena first started working with NGOs like Hamari Muskan and New Light as an[artist, she dealt with the issue by creating complicated installations within gallery spaces that brought up the dark realities of sex trafficking in a very graphic way. But this did not seem right. To create mass awareness, she realised she needed to distill the issue into a simple, engaging piece of art that spoke to everyone and transcended language and space. That is when her public art project MISSING emerged. MISSING was finally launched to great reviews at the India Art Fair in January 2014. The work is larger than life black silhouettes of young girls placed against the urban skyline. Constructed from iron sheets, forged and painted pitch black, they seem like sharp, black cut out of the sky. Holes, into which, millions of girls disappear from the face of the Earth. These expanded forms act as memorials to these young girls who have disappeared, vanished into thin air. It is hoped that these emblematic silhouettes generate curiosity, recognition and finally a sense of deep loss, recovering them to from the abyss of the sky.[3] A recovery that inspires millions of others to act on behalf of the fate of those who have disappeared and are alluded by justice. The works are larger than life black silhouettes of young girls placed against the urban skyline.[4] Constructed from iron, forged and painted pitch black, they seem like sharp, black holes cut out of the sky. Holes, into which millions of girls, disappear from the face of this Earth. These silhouettes will serve as a constant reminder to people about the millions of girls who have disappeared because of humanity's negligence. These also work as memorials of the girls who have gone missing. The public art sculptures were launched at the India Art Fair and recently shown at the Pune Biennale.[5] The Silhouette is seen again and again across the country in the street stencil project. Students, artists and rescued girls, NGOs are joining hands to put the MISSING silhouettes on the city walls. These silhouettes act as constant reminders of the missing girls as well as a remembrance of those gone.[6]
Missing has already created around 1000 stencils across villages and cities in India. MISSING has also been tying up with NGOs and organizations like Rotary Teach Programme, Yes Foundation, Rotaractors, iPartner India, Women and Child Development Ministry, iVolunteer and others who have an all-India presence, to spread the word on the project and the heinous issue of trafficking. The stencil is currently being used as a key awareness tool in a grassroots awareness campaign that MISSING is conducting along with the Women and Child Development Ministry. This campaign aims to spread awareness among highly vulnerable youth across rural communities in West Bengal.[7] MISSING is an interactive game designed to allow players to experience what a missing person goes through when she is trafficked into prostitution, a world into which millions of girls are lost every year.[8] The game is intended for a mature audience, and aims to expose the player to the dark world of human trafficking and raise awareness about it. The player gets into the shoes of the trafficked victim and experiences her frustration, vulnerability, and helplessness, which shakes a player up. Missing's game developer has travelled with Leena Kejriwal, the artist behind the MISSING campaign, to the different red light districts in Kolkata and to rural Bengal from where the girls get trafficked, to better understand the issue. He has been with Missing through the ground research phase and interacted with survivors to understand the core problems, tactics they have to resort to lure a customer and the plight of the trafficked girl. MISSING observed that many youth in vulnerable areas are unaware of the threat of trafficking that is immanent to them. Therefore, it felt that an important step in overcoming sex trafficking is to educate vulnerable populations of the threat it poses to them. There have been a series of talks in schools and colleges to ensure that the Next Generation is aware of the problem at hand. To back the Installations and talks, MISSING has been doing an important ground project in the form of a stencil project across the country, where students, artists and rescued girls, NGOs are working together to put the MISSING silhouettes on the city walls. MISSING's work in rural Bengal has led them to start a livelihood programme that benefits both survivors of trafficking as well as Vulnerable girls in high-trafficking areas. MISSING mentor's girls for tailoring, computer programming, videography and in poultry farming. MISSING hopes that they can in their own right become mentors and role models for others in their community and take the call for End Demand and End Slavery to a new level. Given that poverty is one of the main factors driving the sex trafficking industry, providing economic opportunities to women in Vulnerable communities MISSING can reduce their risk of being

We are associated with national and international platforms and networks.

Odanadi Seva Trust,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odanadi_Seva_Trust,"Odanadi Seva Samsthe (Odanadi Seva Trust) is a social, non-governmental organisation based in Mysore, which has been working for the rescue, rehabilitation, reintegration and empowerment of trafficked and sexually exploited women and children. Established in 1984 by K.V. Stanley and M.L. Parashuram and registered officially in 1993, their rescue operations cover South India. The rehabilitation center is set up in Mysore in Karnataka. Stanly and Parashu, as they are known popularly, were government officials and district coordinators of the Total Literacy Project, who, while interacting with villagers in the Mysore district, came across women who were ignored and shunned because they were sex workers. This led them to give up their jobs and start the Odanadi Seva Samasthe. Since its establishment, Odanadi Seva Samasthe has organised and undertaken over a dozen rescue-operations, propelled by the active involvement of sex workers. More than 400 girls in and around the state of Karnataka have been rescued, and the perpetrators of this traffic have been brought to book. The Trust currently houses 75 rescued children, with the intention of protecting them from the clutches of the sex-trade. They have also been successful in having (over 22) women, that were once part of the trade, marry and settle. The goals of the program include providing shelter, food, education, vocational training, health care and counseling for its residents and creating awareness and influencing policy making related to anti-trafficking.[1] The founders and their team also have awareness programs designed solely to eradicate the stigma associated with women of the flesh trade. The trust conducts several activities oriented towards shoring up its residents ‘moral’ infrastructure including cultural capsules, meditation, recreation, group activities and training. The activities of Odanadi Seva Samasthe have been recognised by the state and the central governments. The Government of Karnataka has allotted two plots of land in Mysore for the rehabilitation of women and children in prostitution. Other state governments (Maharashtra, Delhi, West Bengal) have been sending rescued girls to Odanadi, to facilitate their rehabilitation. Odanadi has consistently received support from NGO's and not-for-profit organisations like AID (Association for India's Development), Asha for Education and Pratham. Asha for Education runs a program titled 'Support a Child' where donors choose to support a child, get to track the progress of that child and interact via letters. The program has received ample support for the children of Odanadi and continues to have the residents participation. The trust has participated in promoting rural education and social awareness in Kodagu District on tie up with sandeepany vidya peeta, somwarpet.[what language is this?]",Odanadi Seva Samsthe Odanadi Seva Trust is a social non governmental organisation based in Mysore which has been working for the rescue rehabilitation reintegration and empowerment of trafficked and sexually exploited women and children Established in 1984 by K V Stanley and M L Parashuram and registered officially in 1993 their rescue operations cover South India The rehabilitation center is set up in Mysore in Karnataka Stanly and Parashu as they are known popularly were government officials and district coordinators of the Total Literacy Project who while interacting with villagers in the Mysore district came across women who were ignored and shunned because they were sex workers This led them to give up their jobs and start the Odanadi Seva Samasthe Since its establishment Odanadi Seva Samasthe has organised and undertaken over a dozen rescue operations propelled by the active involvement of sex workers More than 400 girls in and around the state of Karnataka have been rescued and the perpetrators of this traffic have been brought to book The Trust currently houses 75 rescued children with the intention of protecting them from the clutches of the sex trade They have also been successful in having over 22 women that were once part of the trade marry and settle The goals of the program include providing shelter food education vocational training health care and counseling for its residents and creating awareness and influencing policy making related to anti trafficking The founders and their team also have awareness programs designed solely to eradicate the stigma associated with women of the flesh trade The trust conducts several activities oriented towards shoring up its residents moral infrastructure including cultural capsules meditation recreation group activities and training The activities of Odanadi Seva Samasthe have been recognised by the state and the central governments The Government of Karnataka has allotted two plots of land in Mysore for the rehabilitation of women and children in prostitution Other state governments Maharashtra Delhi West Bengal have been sending rescued girls to Odanadi to facilitate their rehabilitation Odanadi has consistently received support from NGO s and not for profit organisations like AID Association for India s Development Asha for Education and Pratham Asha for Education runs a program titled Support a Child where donors choose to support a child get to track the progress of that child and interact via letters The program has received ample support for the children of Odanadi and continues to have the residents participation The trust has participated in promoting rural education and social awareness in Kodagu District on tie up with sandeepany vidya peeta somwarpet what language is this

Our Children Foundation,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Children_Foundation,"Our Children Foundation (OCF) is a non-profit organisation that provides free education for underprivileged children in India’s rural and semi-rural villages.  The goal of Our Children Foundation is to provide institutional reforms that improve disadvantaged people’s access to, success in, and opportunities from quality education in a sustainable manner.[1] Our Children School is OCF’s first project, which focuses on establishing and reopening education centres in areas with inadequate access to schooling in West Bengal.[2] Our Children Foundation was registered as a Society under West Bengal Society Registration Act XXVI, 1961 on 22 October 2008.[3] Its first school opened on 2 May 2009 in rural Andharmanik village, two hours south of Kolkata.[4] On 22 March 2010, two more schools opened in semi-rural slums of Sahara and Shishumala near Kolkata Airport. As of May 2011, over 35 local teachers had been provided employment and 1000 children were receiving education through OCF's Our Children School projects.[5] Our Children Foundation’s motto, ‘Empowering lives through Education’, reflects its mission to address issues of poverty, healthcare, population control and unemployment through improvements in access to and quality of education, with a focus on India’s younger generations.

Paani Foundation,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paani_Foundation,"Paani Foundation is a non-profit, non-governmental organization which is active in the area of drought prevention and watershed management in the state of Maharashtra, India. The organization was founded by Indian actor Aamir Khan and his wife, Kiran Rao. The CEO of the Foundation is Satyajit Bhatkal. The primary aim of Paani Foundation is to spread knowledge of watershed management and groundwater replenishment. Paani Foundation has been organizing the Satyamev Jayate Water Cup competition since 2016, where villages compete with each other to implement watershed management and water conservation methods in the summer months leading up to the monsoon season.[1][2] The state of Maharashtra in India has a history of recurring droughts and acute water shortage throughout the last several decades (e.g. in 2013). There are both natural and man-made reasons for this situation. One-third of the state falls under the semi-arid climatic zone. Rainfall patterns have been increasingly erratic in recent years due to effects of climate change. Irrigation in the state is 16% of area under cultivation, much lower than the 42% national average. This has led to overuse of bore wells (tube wells), leading to a steep fall in groundwater levels. Water-intensive cash crops such as sugarcane are also cultivated in semi-arid regions, exacerbating the problem.[3] In 2015, the state government officially declared that 60% of its villages were facing a ""drought-like condition"". This means that they reported a crop yield which was less than 50% of the standard yield in the area. In absolute figures, 23,811 of the state's 39,453 villages come in this category. This will result in a drastic fall in the state's agricultural output for the year, officials said. Aamir Khan's TV series Satyamev Jayate, which discussed wide-ranging social issues plaguing India, had originally addressed the issue of water scarcity and the shortcomings of water management in India in the 12th episode of the first season, which was broadcast on 22 July 2012. After the series ended its run in November 2014, Khan and the show's director Satyajit Bhatkal decided to take up a cause that they could stay with for several years and show tangible results. They settled upon the tackling the problem of chronic water shortage in rural Maharashtra. Khan and Bhatkal, along with Khan's wife Kiran Rao and others from the TV series core team spent more than a year understanding the issue and researching possible solutions. In 2016, they set up Paani Foundation.[4] In April-May 2016, India watched in horror as poignant images of drought emerged from its richest state, Maharashtra. A train commissioned by the railways had to be arranged to supply water to Latur city. Yet, in the same year, there was a citizens’ response to drought when the Paani Foundation was formed with a mission to make Maharashtra ‘drought-free’.[5] Satyamev Jayate Water Cup, billed as a ""people's movement against drought"", is the primary event organized by Paani Foundation every year starting late March-early April up to late May-early June. It is a competition among participating villages to complete the maximum possible amount of work for watershed development and water conservation within their habitats before the monsoon season begins. The competition is intended to be a platform to get people to volunteer to carry out watershed development works throughout the periphery of their villages. The foundation selects drought-hit tehsils, trains a group of residents in watershed development and organizes a 45-day ‘water cup’ contest among villages to see who creates the maximum possible rainwater storage capacity, thereby gaming water conservation.[5] The Foundation provides training on technical aspects and social leadership to a small number of representatives from each village before the competition. These representatives (called Jal doot or 'water messengers') are expected to return to their villages and mobilize fellow villagers to work on watershed management structures around the village. The competition rules stress on the importance of shramdaan (volunteer labour) by people. The Foundation itself does not provide financial assistance to carry out works, except bearing the costs of the training program and prizes for the winners. The villages are expected to arrange for finances from internal, government or private sources. The Foundation also has several partner organizations that lease machinery such as excavators, JCBs or offer other expertise to the participating villages, free of cost. However any material or fuel costs have to be borne by the village.[6] The Foundation organized the first Satyamev Jayate Water Cup competition in 2016. The idea was tested in 3 talukas, with 116 villages in its first year. Subsequently, the competition expanded to include several talukas and thousands of villages in the state in the next two years.  The foundation began modestly by selecting only 3 tehsils for the mission, but has scaled up to as many as 4,032 villages spread over 75 drought-hit tehsils in four regions of Maharashtra—Marathwada, Vidarbha, North Maharashtra, and Western Maharashtra in 2018. In 2016 and 2017, the participating villages created an aggregate storage capacity of 10,000 crore litres of water.[5] Paani Foundation is supported by some well-known Indian businesspersons and philanthropic organizations such as the Tata Trusts headed by Ratan Tata, Reliance Foundation, Rajiv Bajaj, Deepak Parekh, and Ajay Piramal. The funds are used by Paani Foundation for administration of the competition, training camps and prizes.[7] The Ahmednagar-based Watershed Organization Trust (WOTR) is the Foundation's Knowledge Partner. It creates content and imparts technical training to participants during training camps.[8] Bharatiya Jain Sanghatana (BJS), a Pune based non-profit organization, was also associated with the Foundation. In 2018, it donated free machine usage hours to villages which have achieved a certain level of work through manual labour.[9] In 2019, for the fourth Water Cup, Paani Foundation joined hands with Ahmednagar-based NGO Snehalaya to raise and route all funds received via donations, towards machine support for villages[10].",Paani Foundation is a non profit non governmental organization which is

Pondicherry Science Forum,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pondicherry_Science_Forum,"Pondicherry Science Forum (PSF)[1] was founded in 1985. PSF believes that science placed before humanity tools which transform society, tools that banish poverty, disease and social backwardness. But for it to be used for such purposes, awareness of potential of science and technology, and a scientific temperament should become an integral part of the life process of the people. It describes itself as ""a non profit, voluntary, public-interest organization"" which is based in Puducherry, India. It works primarily on issues related to science policy and science popularization. The primary objective at the time of the founding of Pondicherry Science Forum was taking science to the people. Extensive work was put into science education, science communication, and making science pedagogy interesting and fun. The PSF works to demystify science and technology. Too often, unjust or oppressive development policies come dressed up as technological necessities. The choice of technology is effected by social, cultural and political factors, but is often presented as if it were only a professional or scientific decision. Such ""expert"" opinion can be effectively questioned only if attempts to do so are backed by knowledge and understanding. Providing for adequate choice of technology also means that more effort needs to be invested in developing technologies that are more equitable and sustainable and that can be accessed by weaker sections of society. The PSF's work is organized into three wings: Development, Science Communication and Women's Empowerment and to carry these tasks out effectively, it has built two more institutional structures: the Centre for Ecology & Rural Development (CERD) and the Samam Makalir Suyasarbu Iyakkam (Samam). PSF coordinated the Bharat Gyan Vigyan Jatha (BGVJ) in 1987 in South India which was catalysed and supported by the Department of Science and Technology of the Government of India and also the Bharat Jan Gyan Vigyan Jatha in 1990. It is also member of the All India Peoples Science Network and the NCSTC-Network. The forum spearheaded the Arivoli Iyakkam (Total Literacy Campaign) in Puducherry along with the Education Department. Puducherry was the first state or union territory to become literate.[citation needed] It also won the King Sejong International UNESCO Literacy Prize in 1992. PSF/CERD works in collaboration with leading science and technology organizations including the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. It is also a recognized Centre of Relevance and Excellence (CORE) group under the Ministry of Science and Technology of India. PSF initiated the first Women's SHG Federation in Puducherry and are the pioneers in women's empowerment through micro-credit and capacity building. PSF started the Centre of Ecology & Rural Development (CERD) a centre exclusively formed for taking up meaningful interventions in health, sanitation, natural resource management, energy, watershed management and information and communications technology for development. In 1989, PSF initiated and supported the Directorate of Education of the Government of Pondicherry in launching the total literacy programme called Puduvai Arivoli Iyakkam[7] (Movement for light of knowledge) Pondicherry which later won the prestigious UNESCO King Sejong Literacy Prize for the best Literacy Programme in 1992 for its content, delivery and concept. In 1994, PSF was awarded the National Award for the Best Science Communication programmes by the Department of Science & Technology, Govt. of India. PSF/CERD was also given an award for its work in renewable energy sources by the Renewable Energy Agency, Govt of Puducherry (REAP).[8] Arogya Iyakkam, a community health programme launched by Pondicherry Science Forum which was later recognized as one of the 10 best community health programmes in the world by World Health Organization Astronomy Workshop PSF along with TNSF brought out the first Children's Tamil Monthly Thulir Magazine[9] In 2012, celebrated the Silver jubilee[10] and to this date continues to be the only magazine of its calibre and content.

Prajwala,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prajwala,"Prajwala is a non-governmental organisation based in Hyderabad, India, devoted exclusively to eradicating forced prostitution and sex trafficking. Founded in 1996 by Ms. Sunitha Krishnan and Brother Jose Vetticatil, the organisation actively works in the areas of prevention, rescue, rehabilitation, reintegration and advocacy to combat trafficking in every dimension and restore dignity to victims of commercial sexual exploitation. Currently, Prajwala runs seventeen transition centers for children of women in prostitution,[1] three crisis counseling centers in police stations, a production-cum-training unit for economic rehabilitation, and a therapeutic shelter home for sex trafficked women and children,[2] the majority of whom are HIV positive.[3] Out of its 200 employees, 70% are survivors themselves.[4] Prajwala also forms partnerships with local communities, civil society, corporate agencies and government bodies on various aspects of prevention, protection and prosecution throughout India and the world.[5] Prajwala holds the conviction that sex trafficking is the worst form of human rights violation and flesh trade the oldest form of sexual slavery. The organisation is dedicated to creating a trafficking-free society where no woman or child is sexually exploited and no human being is treated as a commodity. The larger goal is to demonstrate best field practices for up-scaling, replication and adaptation by state and non-state agencies to ensure anti-trafficking mechanisms are in place. The philosophy of Prajwala evolved after the oldest red light district of Hyderabad city, Mehboob ki Mehindi, was forcibly evacuated in 1996. As a result, thousands of women caught in the clutches of prostitution were suddenly uprooted, homeless and displaced.[6] Based on the women's plea for a dignified future for their children, two visionaries—a Catholic Missionary named Brother Jose Vetticatil and a then Hindu nun Ms. Sunitha Krishnan—joined forces to initiate an intervention to prevent minors from entering the sex trade. This program, called Prevention Through Education, initially consisted of a small school run out of a vacated brothel.[7] The ongoing process of interaction with the women posed a threat to the traffickers, the middle-men, and the brokers, which led to a long challenge and struggle for the core team of Prajwala. The founders were faced with life-threatening situations a number of times,[8] which they braved through with the conviction that a viable alternative is possible. The enormity of the situation and the vastness of the task did not stop Prajwala from making a small change in this community. As the journey progressed, Prajwala's reach expanded to meet the multifold needs of victims and establish a wide range of anti-trafficking initiatives, with full faith in people's participation in the process of social transformation.[9] Over the years, Prajwala evolved need-based interventions through a multi-pronged, strategic approach consisting of five pillars: prevention, rescue, rehabilitation, reintegration and advocacy.[10] Prajwala uses value-based education as a primary tool to prevent children of women in prostitution from entering the flesh trade.[11] The organisation's transition centers in Hyderabad function as bridging schools which not only foster the overall development of the children, but also equip them with the necessary psychosocial and scholastic skills to ensure a bright future that breaks the cycles of poverty and social exclusion. Mothers as well as local leaders serve as key contributors and partners in this program. Till date these centers have reached out to over 7,000 children and prevented them from being inducted into inter-generational prostitution.[12] The organisation also builds the capacities of individuals and groups through active linkage with community members, police and district administration to create a zero tolerance for commercial sexual exploitation.[13] In 2011, Prajwala initiated a mass campaign called Men Against Demand (MAD),[14][15] which mobilises men to take a stand against seeking paid sex and encourages them to fight against sex trafficking by abolishing its demand.[16] Since its inception, Prajwala's Community-based Prevention Program has sensitised over 8 million people.[17] In the initial years, Prajwala had negative experiences with cops, so the Rescue and Restoration Program team worked independently, without police cooperation. However, when a member of the team—an ex-pimp—was brutally murdered in 1999, Prajwala began collaborating with law enforcement officials to conduct joint rescue operations.[18] Sometimes, the men pose as customers, either to act as decoys during a raid or to gather information about a brothel. Survivors work as counselors, giving immediate guidance to the terrified rescued girls. None of them have weapons, and the threat of violence is constant. But Prajwala offers its employees something precious—the opportunity to make a profound impact in people’s lives day after day.[19] Today, Prajwala regularly partners with Anti-Human Trafficking Units (ATHUs), State CID inspectors and Women Protection Cells across India to investigate and rescue women from the flesh trade.[20] The organisation extends moral, financial, legal and social support to victims and ensures that perpetrators are brought to justice.[21] Prajwala also operates three Crisis Counseling Centers in police stations at entry and exit points throughout Hyderabad to identify minors in prostitution and intercept trafficking cases.[22] So far, the organisation has rescued over 9,500 victims[23] from commercial sexual exploitation.[24] In order to address the multi-dimensional needs of trafficked victims, Prajwala facilitates psychological, economic and civic aspects of rehabilitation for rescued children and adults. Prajwala has built a residential shelter home 65 km close to Hyderabad to provide a safe and healing environment for young women and girls rescued from the flesh trade. When they first arrive, victims often attempt to escape or commit suicide due to extreme post-traumatic stress disorder, Stockholm syndrome and life-threatening diseases such as HIV/AIDS, which is why crisis counseling and psychosocial support is provided to aid the healing process.[25] With the help of social workers, medical staff, caretakers and teachers, Prajwala also provides health care, education, yoga & meditation, nutritious diet, therapeutic programs & activities, and life-skills & vocational training.[26] As part of economic empowerment, Prajwala helps survivors acquire the skills and capacities needed to gain a dignified livelihood and thrive independently. In the small-scale production-cum-training unit, survivors become experts in non-conventional trades such as welding, bookbinding, carpentry, desktop publishing and screen printing.[27] Prajwala’s focus has been on tapping the innate potential and strengths of these survivors in ventures aimed at their re-integration into the mainstream society as equals. This means capitalising on the strength that the girls were forced to acquire – their fearlessness and lack of inhibition.[28] The economic rehabilitation strategy involves intensive need and aptitude-based research, combined with market assessment in order to produce viable and sustainable economic opportunities.[29] Prajwala works in cooperation with the corporate sector to place survivors in jobs according to their interests, such as taxi drivers, camera operators, housekeepers, security guards, nursing attendants, masons and more.[30][31] Over the years, hundreds of survivors have been trained in the production-cum-training unit and secured employment outside of the organisation in service, hospitality, and construction industries.[32] Prajwala's final phase of rehabilitation entails gaining a civic identity through provision of immediate relief benefits, housing, health, ration and electoral photo identification cards.[33] Over the years, 521 survivors have been given housing under the weaker section's housing scheme—a subsidised government welfare program.[34] As Nirbhaya project advisor in Kerala,[35] Ms. Krishnan has also successfully appealed the government to provide financial compensation to minor rape victims.[36][37] In order to help survivors successfully reintegrate into mainstream society, Prajwala reunites them with their families, arranges for their marriage and supports independent living arrangements.[38] In 2007, Prajwala launched the survivor's movement Aparajita (meaning “those who remain undefeated against all odds”), which is a network for reintegrated survivors to access social support and a platform for advocacy.[39] A two-day National Survivor's Conference was organised by Prajwala in 2011 in which 40 Aparajita members prepared a charter on the course to be adopted in rescue and rehabilitation of trafficked victims, which was presented to the Supreme Court to implement as a Victim Protection Protocol.[40] Prajwala has worked relentlessly to bring about a change in the attitude of India's government for victim-friendly policies as well as awareness regarding sex trafficking, through political, legal and media advocacy. In 2002, Prajwala conducted an action research and publication of a document entitled The Shattered Innocence on inter-state trafficking from Andhra Pradesh to other states, revealing the reality and magnitude of the crime along with a demographic profile of vulnerable communities.[41] Upon submitting this report to the government, a state-level consultation on the need for a multi-sectoral approach to address the issue emerged.[42] In collaboration with Prajwala, the Department of Women and Child Welfare started taking a proactive role in all post-rescue work. As a result of Prajwala's lobbying efforts, a high-level state coordination committee was formed with secretaries of all relevant government departments. Draft guidelines of the state policy to combat trafficking was prepared by Prajwala, and after state-level cabinet member approval, the policy was brought forth as GO Ms 1 on Jan 1, 2003.[43] In 2013, Prajwala lobbied extensively for an anti-trafficking policy in Kerala called the Nirbhaya Fund Scheme for Women and Children, and Ms. Sunitha Krishnan became the state advisor for this groundbreaking policy.[44] She was also appointed as a member of the Andhra Pradesh State Women's Commission[45] and contributed to India's new Bill on Rape, which was passed in Parliament in 2013[46] to increase punitive measures for sexual violence and assault.[47] Furthermore, Ms. Sunitha Krishnan has conducted sensitisation workshops for thousands of senior police officers, judges, prosecutors and Child Welfare Committee members[48] to equip them with the requisite understanding and skills to effectively handle cases of human trafficking and advocate for child-friendly courts.[49] As a result, police personnel ranking from Superintendents to Sub Inspectors have been trained on how to combat the crime[50] and address the psycho-social needs of victims during and after rescue.[51] In collaboration with internationally acclaimed director Rajesh Touchriver, Prajwala has produced several films on sex trafficking and child sexual abuse to educate and sensitise the masses. The 2005 documentary Anamika—The Nameless[52] won the AC award under ""Best Foreign Award"" category, Best Editing from Festival Cine de Granada and Best Documentary Film Award at the HIFF.[53] The film has since been included in the curriculum of India's National Police Academy and National Judicial Academy.[54] Prajwala's shockingly vivid film The Sacred Face also broke the silence about the horrors of incest among high-level officials in Hyderabad.[55] In 2009, Ms. Sunitha Krishnan gave a speech during an official TED India conference about Prajwala's work, which has since inspired over 2.5 million viewers globally.[56] Her July 2012 appearance on Aamir Khan’s television show Satyamev Jayate was instrumental in not only garnering huge funds but also networking with business owners willing to provide job placements for survivors.[57] In addition, Prajwala sensitised over 3,000 corporate houses through the INK[58] and The Indus Entrepreneurs (TiE) conferences, which made a deep impact on the attendees.[59] In January 2013, Prajwala launched its bilingual feature film on sex trafficking titled Ente in Malayalam and Na Bangaru Talli in Telugu. The Chief Minister of Kerala Shri Oommen Chandy and Social Welfare Minister M. K. Muneer attended the debut audio release of Ente in Kochi[60] as well as the film's premier in Trivandrum. Na Bangaru Talli has won 5 international awards in 2013,[61] including Best Feature Film Award at Trinity International Film Festival, USA and Award of Excellence from IFFCRM, Indonesia.[62] Ms. Sunitha Krishnan is a rare breed of individual who has committed her life as a full-time volunteer in Prajwala. A mental health professional, she has done extensive research and is essentially a field practitioner. She has been instrumental in rescuing thousands of children from severely abusive conditions and restoring childhood to them. Ms. Sunitha Krishnan is making it possible for India's government and citizens organisations to manage jointly a range of protective and rehabilitative services for children and women who have been trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation. For her efforts in the anti-trafficking sector she has been awarded Stree Shakthi Puraskar (National Award), Perdita Huston Human Rights Award and the World Of Children Health Award.[63] Bro Jose Vetticatil was an engineer by training. As a brother belonging to the order of Montfort Brothers of St. Gabriel, Bro Jose was committed to the cause of deprived for 28 years. He was involved in post-earthquake rehabilitation efforts in Latur. His main contribution was in the field of technical training for deprived boys. As the Director of Boys Town, a reputed technical training institute, Bro Jose was instrumental in creating a self-sustaining production-cum-training center. As the erstwhile president of Prajwala, Bro Jose was not only the guiding force behind all interventions but also the master mind behind all the economic rehabilitation programs. After leading Prajwala for over nine years and shaping all its interventions, Bro Jose Vetticatil died on 18 September 2005.[64] Prajwala has received several national and international awards for its outstanding efforts: Based on her courageous and tireless work as an anti-trafficking crusader, Prajwala's founder Ms. Sunitha Krishnan has also received numerous accolades and honors including Real Heroes Award from Reliance Foundation and CNN-IBN (2008),[67] Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report Heroes from US Department of State (2009), John Jay College of Criminal Justice Awards (2011),[68]

stations a production cum training unit for economic rehabilitation and a therapeutic shelter home for sex trafficked women and children the majority of whom are HIV positive Out of its 200 employees 70 are survivors themselves Prajwala also forms partnerships with local communities civil society corporate agencies and government bodies on various aspects of prevention protection and prosecution throughout India and the world Prajwala holds the conviction that sex trafficking is the worst form of human rights violation and flesh trade the oldest form of sexual slavery The organisation is dedicated to creating a trafficking free society where no woman or child is sexually exploited and no human being is treated as a commodity The larger goal is to demonstrate best field practices for up scaling replication and adaptation by state and non state agencies to ensure anti trafficking mechanisms are in place The philosophy of Prajwala evolved after the oldest red light district of Hyderabad city Mehboob ki Mehindi was forcibly evacuated in 1996 As a result thousands of women caught in the clutches of prostitution were suddenly uprooted homeless and displaced Based on the women s plea for a dignified future for their children two visionaries a Catholic Missionary named Brother Jose Vetticatil and a then Hindu nun Ms Sunitha Krishnan joined forces to initiate an intervention to prevent minors from entering the sex trade This program called Prevention Through Education initially consisted of a small school run out of a vacated brothel The ongoing process of interaction with the women posed a threat to the traffickers the middle men and the brokers which led to a long challenge and struggle for the core team of Prajwala The founders were faced with life threatening situations a number of times which they braved through with the conviction that a viable alternative is possible The enormity of the situation and the vastness of the task did not stop Prajwala from making a small change in this community As the journey progressed Prajwala s reach expanded to meet the multifold needs of victims and establish a wide range of anti trafficking initiatives with full faith in people s participation in the process of social transformation Over the years Prajwala evolved need based interventions through a multi pronged strategic approach consisting of five pillars prevention rescue rehabilitation reintegration and advocacy Prajwala uses value based education as a primary tool to prevent children of women in prostitution from entering the flesh trade The organisation s transition centers in Hyderabad function as bridging schools which not only foster the overall development of the children but also equip them with the necessary psychosocial and scholastic skills to ensure a bright future that breaks the cycles of poverty and social exclusion Mothers as well as local leaders serve as key contributors and partners in this program Till date these centers have reached out to over 7 000 children and prevented them from being inducted into inter generational prostitution The organisation also builds the capacities of individuals and groups through active linkage with community members police and district administration to create a zero tolerance for commercial sexual exploitation In 2011 Prajwala initiated a mass campaign called Men Against Demand MAD which mobilises men to take a stand against seeking paid sex and encourages them to fight against sex trafficking by abolishing its demand Since its inception Prajwala s Community based Prevention Program has sensitised over 8 million people In the initial years Prajwala had negative experiences with cops so the Rescue and Restoration Program team worked independently without police cooperation However when a member of the team an ex pimp was brutally murdered in 1999 Prajwala began collaborating with law enforcement officials to conduct joint rescue operations Sometimes the men pose as customers either to act as decoys during a raid or to gather information about a brothel Survivors work as counselors giving immediate guidance to the terrified rescued girls None of them have weapons and the threat of violence is constant But Prajwala offers its employees something precious the opportunity to make a profound impact in people s lives day after day Today Prajwala regularly partners with Anti Human Trafficking Units ATHUs State CID inspectors and Women Protection Cells across India to investigate and rescue women from the flesh trade The organisation extends moral financial legal and social support to victims and ensures that perpetrators are brought to justice Prajwala also operates three Crisis Counseling Centers in police stations at entry and exit points throughout Hyderabad to identify minors in prostitution and intercept trafficking cases So far the organisation has rescued over 9 500 victims from commercial sexual exploitation In order to address the multi dimensional needs of trafficked victims Prajwala facilitates psychological economic and civic aspects of rehabilitation for rescued children and adults Prajwala has built a residential shelter home 65 km close to Hyderabad to provide a safe and healing environment for young women and girls rescued from the flesh trade When they first arrive victims often attempt to escape or commit suicide due to extreme post traumatic stress disorder Stockholm syndrome and life threatening diseases such as HIV AIDS which is why crisis counseling and psychosocial support is provided to aid the healing process With the help of social workers medical staff caretakers and teachers Prajwala also provides health care education yoga meditation nutritious diet therapeutic programs activities and life skills vocational training As part of economic empowerment Prajwala helps survivors acquire the skills and capacities needed to gain a dignified livelihood and thrive independently In the small scale production cum training unit survivors become experts in non conventional trades such as welding bookbinding carpentry desktop publishing and screen printing Prajwala s focus has been on tapping the innate potential and strengths of these survivors in ventures aimed at their re integration into the mainstream society as equals This means capitalising on the strength that the girls were forced to acquire their fearlessness and lack of inhibition The economic rehabilitation strategy involves intensive need and aptitude based research combined with market assessment in order to produce viable and sustainable economic opportunities Prajwala works in cooperation with the corporate sector to place survivors in jobs according to their interests such as taxi drivers camera operators housekeepers security guards nursing attendants masons and more Over the years hundreds of survivors have been trained in the production cum training unit and secured employment outside of the organisation in service hospitality and construction industries Prajwala s final phase of rehabilitation entails gaining a civic identity through provision of immediate relief benefits housing health ration and electoral photo identification cards Over the years 521 survivors have been given housing under the weaker section s housing scheme a subsidised government welfare program As Nirbhaya project advisor in Kerala Ms Krishnan has also successfully appealed the government to provide financial compensation to minor rape victims In order to help survivors successfully reintegrate into mainstream society Prajwala reunites them with their families arranges for their marriage and supports independent living arrangements In 2007 Prajwala launched the survivor s movement Aparajita meaning those who remain undefeated against all odds which is a network for reintegrated survivors to access social support and a platform for advocacy A two day National Survivor s Conference was organised by Prajwala in 2011 in which 40 Aparajita members prepared a charter on the course to be adopted in rescue and rehabilitation of trafficked victims which was presented to the Supreme Court to implement as a Victim Protection Protocol Prajwala has worked relentlessly to bring about a change in the attitude of India s government for victim friendly policies as well as awareness regarding sex trafficking through political legal and media advocacy In 2002 Prajwala conducted an action research and publication of a document entitled The Shattered Innocence on inter state trafficking from Andhra Pradesh to other states revealing the reality and magnitude of the crime along with a demographic profile of vulnerable communities Upon submitting this report to the government a state level consultation on the need for a multi sectoral approach to address the issue emerged In collaboration with Prajwala the Department of Women and Child Welfare started taking a proactive role in all post rescue work As a result of Prajwala s lobbying efforts a high level state coordination committee was formed with secretaries of all relevant government departments Draft guidelines of the state policy to combat trafficking was prepared by Prajwala and after state level cabinet member approval the policy was brought forth as GO Ms 1 on Jan 1 2003 In 2013 Prajwala lobbied extensively for an anti trafficking policy in Kerala called the Nirbhaya Fund Scheme for Women and Children and Ms Sunitha Krishnan became the state advisor for this groundbreaking policy She was also appointed as a member of the Andhra Pradesh State Women s Commission and contributed to India s new Bill on Rape which was passed in Parliament in 2013 to increase punitive measures for sexual violence and assault Furthermore Ms Sunitha Krishnan has conducted sensitisation workshops for thousands of senior police officers judges prosecutors and Child Welfare Committee members to equip them with the requisite understanding and skills to effectively handle cases of human trafficking and advocate for child friendly courts As a result police personnel ranking from Superintendents to Sub Inspectors have been trained on how to combat the crime and address the psycho social needs of victims during and after rescue In collaboration with internationally acclaimed director Rajesh Touchriver Prajwala has produced several films on sex trafficking and child sexual abuse to educate and sensitise the masses The 2005 documentary Anamika The Nameless won the AC award under Best Foreign Award category Best Editing from Festival Cine de Granada and Best Documentary Film Award at the HIFF The film has since been included in the curriculum of India s National Police Academy and National Judicial Academy Prajwala s shockingly vivid film The Sacred Face also broke the silence about the horrors of incest among high level officials in Hyderabad In 2009 Ms Sunitha Krishnan gave a speech during an official TED India conference about Prajwala s work which has since inspired over 2 5 million viewers globally Her July 2012 appearance on Aamir Khan s television show Satyamev Jayate was instrumental in not only garnering huge funds but also networking with business owners willing to provide job placements for survivors In addition Prajwala sensitised over 3 000 corporate houses through the INK and The Indus Entrepreneurs TiE conferences which made a deep impact on the attendees In January 2013 Prajwala launched its bilingual feature film on sex trafficking titled Ente in Malayalam and Na Bangaru Talli in Telugu The Chief Minister of Kerala Shri Oommen Chandy and Social Welfare Minister M K Muneer attended the debut audio release of Ente in Kochi as well as the film s premier in Trivandrum Na Bangaru Talli has won 5 international awards in 2013 including Best Feature Film Award at Trinity International Film Festival USA and Award of Excellence from IFFCRM Indonesia

PRS Legislative Research,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRS_Legislative_Research,"PRS Legislative Research, commonly referred to as PRS, is an Indian non-profit organisation that was established in September 2005 as an independent research institute to make the Indian legislative process better informed, more transparent and participatory. PRS is based in New Delhi, India. Each Member of Parliament (MP) in India represents over two million constituents.[2] The Indian Parliament passes an average of 60 Bills every year. MPs make laws and address complex policy issues across a wide range of sectors.  Given the diversity of issues and the technical nature of many of them, it is not possible for MPs to be well versed on all such issues. It is in this context that PRS provides MPs analysis on legislation and policy to help them prepare for parliamentary debates. PRS was co-founded by C.V. Madhukar and M.R. Madhavan in 2005.  M.R. Madhavan is currently the President of PRS. The Board of Directors is headed by Mr. S. Ramadorai.  The initiative was incubated in the Centre for Policy Research (CPR), New Delhi, which is a leading Indian think tank.  Since 2013, the initiative has been institutionalised as the Institute for Policy Research Studies, a not-for-profit Section 8 Company. The work of PRS is entirely funded through philanthropic donations and grants by a number of Indian institutions and individuals. PRS regularly interacts with MPs, providing them with research inputs and analysis to support their work in Parliament. PRS shares its analysis on legislation [3] with all MPs in both houses of Parliament.  Many MPs reach out to PRS for individual briefings as well as research on specific topics. PRS also engages with Members of State Legislative Assemblies (MLAs) to provide them research support for their role as legislators. PRS also regularly conducts policy workshops for MLAs which provides state legislators with an opportunity to interact with policy experts and fellow legislators from other states to discuss policy challenges in their states. The Legislators Knowledge Network is another such platform for MLAs to engage with each other. PRS research is fact-based and analytical, and PRS does not provide recommendations or opinions. It directly briefs MPs across all political parties from both the treasury and opposition benches of both the Houses of Parliament. Some of PRS research products include: PRS engages with civil society organisations and the media to enable greater engagement with the legislative process.  The media regularly accesses PRS for data and analysis related to Parliament and legislation.[4] The PRS website[5] is updated daily on Parliament’s activities and legislative news. Engagement with citizens is facilitated through the PRS Blog, Twitter and Facebook pages. Workshops are held for journalists on tracking the activities of MPs and MLAs. In addition, PRS provides inputs to the press and electronic media on the legislative agenda in Parliament, as well as data on legislative performance. Members of the PRS team are often approached to contribute columns to provide a perspective on various key Bills and Parliament’s functioning. PRS collates detailed data and information about Parliament’s functioning. It prepares detailed reports providing timely updates about business in Parliament before and after each session. PRS enables citizens to track the activity of their MPs in Parliament through an online MP track tool.[6] It tracks the MP’s engagement during sessions on different parameters such as Questions asked, Private Members’ Bill introduced, participation in Debates and Attendance. Towards the general elections 2014, PRS launched an SMS Tool to enable a citizen to identify and track the performance of his/her MP by typing MP <six digit pin code> and sending it to the number +919223051616. The Network is a forum for legislators to interact and share policy initiatives on issues of common interest. The objective is to create a platform for MLAs to showcase positive developments in their states, share and learn best practices, and foster a culture of learning from the experiences of other states on relevant issues. PRS conceptualised and developed the Laws of India website,[7] which is an online database with nearly 4000 laws from most states across the country. Free online access is provided to all these laws. The Legislative Assistants to Members of Parliament (LAMP) Fellowship was conceptualised by PRS to create a platform for young Indians to engage with policy making at the national level. The LAMP Fellowship places one legislative assistant to work with an MP. The LAMP Fellows are engaged full-time for eleven months to work with the assigned MP over three parliamentary sessions. Throughout the eleven months, the LAMP Fellow works closely with the MP, providing extensive research support for his/her parliamentary work. In the first cohort of the LAMP Fellowship, 12 young individuals were selected and trained to work with MPs from both Houses of Parliament, across different political parties. In the following years, the programme was expanded to have over 40 Fellows each year. LAMP Fellows 2010-11 [8]

Read India,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read_India,"Pratham is one of the largest non-governmental organisations in India.[1] It was co-founded by Madhav Chavan and Farida Lambay . It works towards the provision of quality education to the underprivileged children in India. Established in Mumbai in 1994 to provide pre-school education to children in slums, Pratham today has interventions spread across 23 states and union territories of India [2]  and has supporting chapters in the United States, UK, Germany, Sweden, and Australia. Pratham's founder and Ex-CEO, Madhav Chavan, was the 2011 recipient of the Skoll Award for Social Entrepreneurship.[3] In addition, Pratham received the 2013 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Development Cooperation, as a result of successfully catering to the learning needs of tens of millions of disadvantaged children for over twenty years. In doing so, it has designed and implemented new methods that accelerate reading acquisition, using a grassroots approach in which pupils are grouped by actual levels and needs instead of age, while providing specific training to the teachers and volunteers recruited to its programs. UNICEF originally set up the Bombay Education Initiative in Mumbai to establish a tripartite-partnership between the government, corporate and civil society to improve India's primary education. This led to the formation of Pratham as an independent charity in 1994. Pratham started by holding balwadis (pre-education classes) for children in Mumbai's slums. Volunteers were recruited to teach in spaces within communities, including temples, offices, and even people's homes. The Pratham pre-school classes multiplied and were replicated in other locations.[5] Pratham's mission is ""Every Child in School and Learning well"". By increasing the literacy levels of India's poor which account for about one third of the world's poor, Pratham aims to improve India's economic and social equality. This is carried out through the introduction of low cost education models that are sustainable and reproducible.[6] Annual Status of Education Report (ASER), India's largest NGO-run annual survey, has been conducted by Pratham since 2005 to evaluate the relevance and impact of its programs. Findings are disseminated at national, state, district and village levels, and influence education policies at both state and central levels.[7] Read India - Despite India's educational reforms in recent years, quality education is still a concern, especially among low-income communities.[8] Findings of ASER 2005 and 2006 revealed that 50% of children in government schools could not read, write or do basic arithmetic despite being in school for 4–5 years.[9] Hence Read India was launched in 2007 to improve reading, writing and basic arithmetic skills of 6- to 14-year-old children and is carried out by school teachers, anganwadi workers and volunteers, whom Pratham trains. Read India has reached approximately 34 million children to date, resulting in large-scale improvements in literacy levels across several states in India.[10] Pratham Books, a non-profit organisation which publishes affordable, quality books for children, was set up in 2004 to complement Read India. It has published over 200 original titles in 10 Indian languages and reached over 14 million children.[11] Direct programmes – Pratham's direct programmes seek to supplement governmental efforts to improve quality of education through balwadis (pre-school education), learning support programs, libraries and mainstreaming drop-out children. Full-year learning support is provided at centres for children living in the immediate vicinity. These programmes are typically conducted in urban slums or poor villages, where children do not have easy access to quality education.[12] Lakhon Mein Ek is a call-to-action campaign by Pratham Education Foundation and ASER Centre. Together with citizens from across the country, the organisation worked towards improving the status of children's learning in 100,000 villages and communities. The campaign started on 21 October 2015 and by 11 January 2016, the campaign had reached more than 150,000 villages and communities. Furthermore, over 300,000 volunteers had joined the campaign and interacted with about 1 crore (10 million) children. By 16 January 2016 success of the campaign will be marked by citizens everywhere resolving to help children acquire basic reading and math abilities in these locations.[13] Other Work - Pratham  has also set up other programmes for disadvantaged Indian children and youth, including Pratham Council for Vulnerable Children (PCVC), Early Childhood Care and Education Centre (ECCE), Vocational Skills Programme,  and Computer-aided Literacy.[14] Computer Assisted Learning Project with Pratham in India Banerjee, Abhijit, Shawn Cole, Esther Duflo, and Leigh Lindon. 2007.

Foreign contributions to non-profits are governed by FC(R)A regulations and the Home Ministry. For an organisation to be termed as charity it requires Income tax clearances under 12 A Clause of Income Tax Act. Section 2(15) of the Income Tax Act defines ‘charitable purpose’ to include ‘relief of the poor, education, medical relief and the advancement of any other object of general public utility’. A purpose that relates exclusively to religious teaching or worship is not considered as charitable. Registering a Non Profit in India can be done in a total of five ways: A public charitable trust is usually floated when there is a property involved, especially in terms of land and building. Different states in India have different Trusts Acts in force, which govern the trusts in the state. In the absence of a Trusts Act in any particular state or territory, the general principles of the Indian Trusts Act, 1882 are applied. The main instrument of any public charitable trust is the trust deed, wherein the aims and objects and mode of management (of the trust) should be enshrined. In every trust deed, the minimum and maximum number of trustees has to be specified. The trust deed should clearly spell out the aims and objects of the trust, how the trust should be managed, how other trustees may be appointed or removed, etc. The trust deed should be signed by both the settlor/s and trustee/s in the presence of two witnesses. The trust deed should be executed on non-judicial stamp paper, the value of which would depend on the valuation of the trust property.

The Robin Hood Army believes it is just 1% done in its war against hunger and plans to grow its presence worldwide in the next few years. The Robin Hood Army originated in New Delhi, India, and then eventually spread its operations to other Indian cities such as Kolkata, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Jaipur, Jabalpur, Panipat, Gurgaon, Pune Dehradun, Faridabad, Ahmedabad, Surat.[4] On February 15, 2015, the Robin Hood Army commenced its activities in Karachi, Pakistan.[5] The organisation functions on and propagates the basic ideology of self-sustained communities across the city i.e. each locality/community within the city will contribute towards providing food to the needy through its local volunteers and restaurants. Currently the organisation has tied up with multiple restaurants across the 60 cities that provide them with food. The organisation does not accept monetary donations and only distributes the food or donations in kind that it receives from its restaurant partners and donors. The Robin Hood Army, wearing green T-shirts,[6] applies the following principles to further its cause: The Robin Hood actively leverages Facebook and Twitter to generate awareness and inspire new volunteers to join. The organisation routinely launches social media campaigns on special occasions or festivals. Robin Hood Army (RHA) initiated its Karachi, Pakistan operations on February 15, 2015, which coincided with the India-Pakistan cricket match of the ICC Cricket World Cup, 2015.[18] Between February 2015 and February 2017, the Robin Hood Army has set up chapters in 10 more countries including Bangladesh, Nepal & Sri Lanka in the Indian Sub-Continent, Malaysia, Philippines & Indonesia in South-East Asia, Egypt in Africa, Mexico in North America and Melbourne in Australia. In February 2018, RHA Canada was started in the Greater Toronto Area. In July 2016, the Robin Hood Academy was started with the purpose to bridge the gap between streets and school. By giving access to basic values and primary education Robin Hood Academy empowers students by developing their inclination towards learning. As of December 2019, the Robin Hood Academy has empowered 6000+ street children with basic primary education. The Robins conduct regular classes and excursions with a standardized curriculum to introduce and drive the spirit of learning. Along with teaching the students, the Robins also support students with the procedure for enrollment into government schools and as of December 2019 they've managed to get 1700 school admissions for street children across 75 cities. The founding team of the Robin Hood Army has given multiple TEDx talks on how a community can come together to create a wider and real difference.",The Robin Hood Army is a volunteer based Zero funds organisation that works to get surplus food from restaurants to the less fortunate sections of society in cities across India and 12 other countries The organisation consists of over 52620 volunteers approximately in 178 cities and have served food to over 16 7 million people so far The volunteers people from all walks of life The less fortunate sections who the organisation reaches out to include homeless families orphanages night shelters homes for abandoned children patients from public hospitals etc The Robin Hood Army was founded by Neel Ghose and Anand Sinha The food distributed to the needy is sourced from restaurants which regularly provide surplus or freshly cooked food on a goodwill basis The Robin Hood Army believes it is just 1 done in its war against hunger and plans to grow its presence worldwide in the next few years The Robin Hood Army originated in New Delhi India and then eventually spread its operations to other Indian cities such as Kolkata Mumbai Hyderabad Bangalore Jaipur Jabalpur Panipat Gurgaon Pune Dehradun Faridabad Ahmedabad Surat On February 15 2015 the Robin Hood Army commenced its activities in Karachi Pakistan The organisation functions on and propagates the basic ideology of self sustained communities across the city i e each locality community within the city will contribute towards providing food to the needy through its local volunteers and restaurants Currently the organisation has tied up with multiple restaurants across the 60 cities that provide them with food The organisation does not accept monetary donations and only distributes the food or donations in kind that it receives from its restaurant partners and donors The Robin Hood Army wearing green T shirts applies the following principles to further its cause The Robin Hood actively leverages Facebook and Twitter to generate awareness and inspire new volunteers to join The organisation routinely launches social media campaigns on special occasions or festivals Robin Hood Army RHA initiated its Karachi Pakistan operations on February 15 2015 which coincided with the India Pakistan cricket match of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 Between February 2015 and February 2017 the Robin Hood Army has set up chapters in 10 more countries including Bangladesh Nepal Sri Lanka in the Indian Sub Continent Malaysia Philippines Indonesia in South East Asia Egypt in Africa Mexico in North America and Melbourne in Australia In February 2018 RHA Canada was started in the Greater Toronto Area In July 2016 the Robin Hood Academy was started with the purpose to bridge the gap between streets and school By giving access to basic values and primary education Robin Hood Academy empowers students by developing their inclination towards learning As of December 2019 the Robin Hood Academy has empowered 6000 street children with basic primary education The Robins conduct regular classes and excursions with a standardized curriculum to introduce and drive the spirit of learning Along with teaching the students the Robins also support students with the procedure for enrollment into government schools and as of December 2019 they ve managed to get 1700 school admissions for street children across 75 cities The founding team of the Robin Hood Army has given multiple TEDx talks on how a community can come together to create a wider and real difference

Samata (NGO),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samata_(NGO),"Samata is an India-based non-governmental organization that focuses on advocacy and development issues among tribal communities in Andhra Pradesh. Samata helps tribal groups address problems of land alienation, displacement, and political dis-empowerment. Its mission is to uphold the traditional, constitutional, and human rights of the tribal or adivasi people. Samata focuses primarily on projects in the tribal villages of East Godavari and Vizag districts in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India. This region forms a part of the Eastern Ghats range of mountains. Samata achieved NGO status in 1990 and has become one of the primary advocates for tribal and adivasi rights in India. It continually expanded as an organization, taking on new campaigns and issues as the demand for its services grew in the 1990s and into the new millennium. In 1987 Samata was formed to mobilize groups of tribal and rural youth against exploitation by non-tribal people and address the government's neglect of the villages of Mallapuram, East Godavari District of Andhra Pradesh. Samata applied tribal land protection laws to prevent further abuse of tribal land rights, and they eventually won the implementation of government programs in 49 villages of the area that led to the construction of primary schools, housing, roads, drinking water projects, and electricity grids. Samata was formally registered as a non-government organization in August 1990 under the Indian Societies Registration Act. The day after their official formation, New projects and campaigns followed the early actions in Mallapuram. Samata organized communities in the hills of Poolabanda, Andhra Pradesh and facilitated an ongoing dialogue with government officials covering primary education, development projects, and environmental rights. In Sovva, Orissa Samata helped farmers form the Vegetable Growers’ Cooperative and successfully lobby the Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA) for assistance with the transportation of their goods to the market. During an organizing session on tribal land alienation in January 1993, villagers informed Samata of mining companies acquiring tribal land specifically protected by the Fifth Schedule of the Indian Constitution referring to Scheduled Tribes. Samata mobilized a grassroots movement among villagers in the affected areas and began a legal battle that same year. They filed a case in the local court and again in the High Court against the Government of A.P for leasing tribal lands to private mining companies in the scheduled areas. The High Court dismissed the case after which Samata filed a special leave petition in the Supreme Court of India. In July 1997 by a three judge-bench. In its final verdict the Supreme Court of India declared that the term ‘person’ would include both natural persons as well as juristic persons, including constitutional governments, and that all lands leased by the government or its agencies to private mining companies in the scheduled areas were null and void. It also held that transfer of land to the government or its instrumentalities is an
entrustment of public property. Since public corporations function in public interest, such transfers were upheld. For the last ten years Samata has focused on community-based development with the following objectives: Within a larger development context, Samata explored ways of creating holistic approaches to supporting tribal groups struggling for land rights, environmental protection, and a responsive democracy. Samata's action took the form of grassroots campaigns to address the problems and issues facing tribal groups. These campaigns included: Samata, having played the role of a community-based micro level development organisation with its focus on organising tribal communities shifted its focus to advocacy and to providing support to address the macro issues of the region of north coastal Andhra Pradesh and Southern Orissa. 
Under the changed perspective, Samata’s new focus is: 1. Capacity building : Samata, with its vast experience in community organisation, provides capacity building support to small groups and local organisations working for people’s rights as they find it difficult to obtain information and inputs on their own. Samata assists ten community-based organizations in north coastal Andhra Pradesh in capacity building, education and health, legal aid, linkages, information and documentation, organisation management, financial support, campaign support, marketing and technical expertise. 2. Mines, Minerals & People: Samata is the National Secretariat for a national network of communities, NGO’s, resource organisations and several concerned institutions and individuals called Mines, Minerals & PEOPLE (mm&P). This network addresses the problems of communities and mine-workers affected by mining and also its impacts on the environment. It has about 150 member groups from 16 states in the country. The network support local campaigns through information, linkages, legal, media, technical and policy support on mining issues and highlights them at a national and international level. 3. Industry Watch: Samata, being an advocacy and support group, monitors the proposed and existing industries and development projects in the state of A.P in order to act as a vigilant civil society. It participates in public hearings, accesses information and disseminates it to the local communities affected. It takes up legal, technical and media advocacy on urban and rural environment issues affected by industries. 4. Support to Development Activities: Samata implements development programmes in the tribal villages through local community participation to meet their basic requirements of housing, drinking water, education, health services, etc. by linking up with either government departments like Tribal Welfare, Panchayat Raj and Rural Development, Forest Department, etc. or with institutions/organizations concerned with the development of tribals. Samata also encourages communities to build up local sustainable institutions for over-coming exploitation through women’s thrift societies, forest protection committees, health and education committees and farmers’ associations. 5. Direct legal services: Legal aid which is most crucial for marginalised communities fighting for their rights is inaccessible to them. Inability to understand the laws or approach the judiciary on their own makes local communities and small organisations working with them vulnerable to exploitation by the state and other forces. Samata provides direct legal services to communities and groups by helping in legal problems like false criminal cases, illegal custodies, getting bails, harassment and human rights violations, land alienation, either through writ petitions or public interest litigations. It takes up legal action and advocacy on issues related to tribal, forest, environment, industrial violations of the Constitution. 6. Campaign support and legal advocacy: Samata provides assistance to local struggles of tribals, farmers, fishermen, etc. who are fighting in the region for their specific rights of land, water, resources and struggles against displacement by industries. Local groups in Orissa and North Coastal Andhra Pradesh have asked Samata for guidance in organising committees, dissemination of information, planning and implementing campaign strategies, cultural training, help in legal advocacy through public interest litigations and writs, spreading legal awareness and literature among communities, etc. 7. Information support: Communities affected by private or government projects have a right to information on these projects and their likely impacts. Information should also be accessible to local groups and communities on legal rights, laws and regulations, and other programmes relevant to them. As there is an information-vacuum due to reluctance from government and industries in sharing it, Samata collects information, compiles into brief informative documents and disseminates it. Demystifying legal and technical information, particularly in the context of development projects and spreading this literature in the vernacular is another important activity of Samata. 8. Media advocacy: Media being the most powerful instrument of publishing information, gathering information, creating public awareness and acting as a pressure on the government to follow transparency and objectivity in its policies and programmes, Samata has been using media advocacy in all its campaign for the protection of peoples rights. Samata would concentrate on developing media advocacy for the issues of the Eastern Ghats and to give strength to local struggles. 9. Linkages: Small local groups need to come out of their isolated struggles as issues affecting people are based on micro-level policies of the state. Samata, with its experience and access to other people’s networks helps local struggles by providing linkages to larger movements and fora so as to build up a strong lobby support for the issues in the region. 10. Technical expertise and alternatives: Samata supports small organisations and communities with technical expertise in seeking alternative sustainable development designs which can be managed by the communities. This includes harnessing locally available natural resources for meeting basic needs of drinking water, electricity, irrigation, housing, etc. appropriate to the area. With the help of the technical experts Samata also takes up impact assessment studies and gives constructive alternatives which are ecologically and socially enduring and press for balanced development policies of the government. 11. Research and Documentation: Samata takes up research, studies and prepares reports on issues related to tribals/scheduled areas, mining, forestry, environment, human rights, land alienation, rural development programmes, legal issues, etc. Some of the studies undertaken Samata have been on the impact of the Joint Forest Management program in A.P, the impact of Water Users’ Associations, feasibility studies for micro-hydel projects, socio-economic status of mining affected tribals in Anantagiri mandal of A.P, etc. ORGANISATION DETAILS: Registered under Societies Registration Act XXI

Sambhali Trust,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambhali_Trust,"Sambhali Trust (Rising of the deprived women) is a nonprofit organisation based in Jodhpur, India. Founded in 2007, the organisation aims to empower Dalit women and children in Rajasthan through educational programs, vocational training, and social services. The trust is active in Jodhpur and Setrawa, and reaches approximately 800 per year.[1][2][3] Sambhali Trust was founded on 16 January 2007 by Govind Singh Rathore, after experiencing violence and discrimination against the women of his family. Hence, Sambhali Trust was created to help alleviate Rajasthani women out of poverty and financial dependence on their families. This was initially done by creating a platform to teach basic Hindi, English, mathematics and sewing for free to women and girls in Jodhpur, and later Setrawa, through ""empowerment centres"". The aim of this training is to enable women and girls to acquire the  skills and knowledge required to find or create employment for themselves. The name ""Sambhali"" means ""rising of the deprived women"".[4][5] The trust now consists of 16 projects; seven empowerment centres, two sewing centres, educational programs and scholarship funding, the ""No Bad Touch"" project, one women's shelter service, one self-help groups and a toll-free helpline. Each project is headed by a project manager, with additional support from subject teachers or assistants. 10 teachers in Hindi and Sewing, many of them graduates of the Sambhali program themselves, are employed by the trust, with approximately 15-30 other teachers working on a voluntary basis from all over the world. Predominantly these volunteers teach English and Mathematics with some specialising in fashion and design and others working within the administration of the trust. The trust has five trustees, with Govind Singh Rathore acting as Managing Trustee. A national and international advisory board also partake in decision making. Sambhali Trust is financed mainly through foreign donations and grants. Since 2013 Sambhali Trust has been affiliated with sister Austrian, German, Swiss and British organisations – Sambhali Austria, Sambhali Germany, Sambhali Switzerland and Sambhali UK respectively. Donations through these sister organisations are all directed to the central, Indian based Trust Located across Jodhpur and Setrawa, empowerment centers provide women and girls with cost free access to education in Hindi, English, and Mathematics. Women are also trained in the traditional arts of sewing and needlework. This enables them to manufacture their own products after training, or to go on and work for Sambhali Trust in the sewing centres.
The sewing centres employ over 20 women to produce handmade fashion and accessories for the Sambhali Boutique, based in Jodhpur, as well as bespoke orders for overseas.[6][7][8]
Sambhali Trust funds over 190 children to attend school in Jodhpur through a scholarship program and boarding home. Additionally, the trust runs the ""No Bad Touch"" project which educates children, teachers, and parents about child sexual abuse. It is currently the only organisation in Rajasthan to openly address this issue. Since the ""No Bad Touch"" project was launched in April 2014, Sambhali Trust has attended over 20 schools and reached over 2000 students.[9]
In 2014 Sambhali Trust introduced the Nirbhaya Helpline.[10] This service provides help and counselling to women in need, and is the first toll-free women's helpline to operate in Rajasthan. The Panaah Shelter Service, founded 2012, is also run and funded by Sambhali and acts as a short term refuge for women caught in violent or difficult situations. Additionally, Sambhali Trust facilitates the Sheerni Self-Help Group Project. The Self-Help project was established to help women by providing them with a means of saving money and access to loans.[11] The aim of this is to allow them to create small enterprises of their own and work towards financial independence.[12]",Sambhali Trust Rising of the deprived women is a nonprofit organisation based in Jodhpur India Founded in 2007 the organisation aims to empower Dalit women and children in Rajasthan through educational programs vocational training and social services The trust is active in Jodhpur and Setrawa and reaches approximately 800 per year Sambhali Trust was founded on 16 January 2007 by Govind Singh Rathore after experiencing violence and discrimination against the women of his family Hence Sambhali Trust was created to help alleviate Rajasthani women out of poverty and financial dependence on their families This was initially done by creating a platform to teach basic Hindi English mathematics and sewing for free to women and girls in Jodhpur and later Setrawa through empowerment centres The aim of this training is to enable women and girls to acquire the skills and knowledge required to find or create employment for themselves The name Sambhali means rising of the deprived women The trust now consists of 16 projects seven empowerment centres two sewing centres educational programs and scholarship funding the No Bad Touch project one women s shelter service one self help groups and a toll free helpline Each project is headed by a project manager with additional support from subject teachers or assistants 10 teachers in Hindi and Sewing many of them graduates of the Sambhali program themselves are employed by the trust with approximately 15 30 other teachers working on a voluntary basis from all over the world Predominantly these volunteers teach English and Mathematics with some specialising in fashion and design and others working within the administration of the trust The trust has five trustees with Govind Singh Rathore acting as Managing Trustee A national and international advisory board also partake in decision making Sambhali Trust is financed mainly through foreign donations and grants Since 2013 Sambhali Trust has been affiliated with sister Austrian German Swiss and British organisations Sambhali Austria Sambhali Germany Sambhali Switzerland and Sambhali UK respectively Donations through these sister organisations are all directed to the central Indian based Trust Located across Jodhpur and Setrawa empowerment centers provide women and girls with cost free access to education in Hindi English and Mathematics Women are also trained in the traditional arts of sewing and needlework This enables them to manufacture their own products after training or to go on and work for Sambhali Trust in the sewing centres The sewing centres employ over 20 women to produce handmade fashion and accessories for the Sambhali Boutique based in Jodhpur as well as bespoke orders for overseas Sambhali Trust funds over 190 children to attend school in Jodhpur through a scholarship program and boarding home Additionally the trust runs the No Bad Touch project which educates children teachers and parents about child sexual abuse It is currently the only organisation in Rajasthan to openly address this issue Since the No Bad Touch project was launched in April 2014 Sambhali Trust has attended over 20 schools and reached over 2000 students In 2014 Sambhali Trust introduced the Nirbhaya Helpline This service provides help and counselling to women in need and is the first toll free women s helpline to operate in Rajasthan The Panaah Shelter Service founded 2012 is also run and funded by Sambhali and acts as a short term refuge for women caught in violent or difficult situations Additionally Sambhali Trust facilitates the Sheerni Self Help Group Project The Self Help project was established to help women by providing them with a means of saving money and access to loans The aim of this is to allow them to create small enterprises of their own and work towards financial independence

Sanatan Sangeet Sanskriti,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanatan_Sangeet_Sanskriti,"Sanatan Sangeet Sanskriti was established in 1993 by Ram Krishan & Sons Charitable Trust to recognize services rendered in music and dance. In 1993, the Sanatan Sangeet Sanskriti, had started presenting two National Awards every year in recognition of the services rendered in the field of music and dance. These awards are called “Sanatan Sangeet Samman” and “Sanatan Sangeet Puraskar”. “Sanatan” in Sanskrit means “eternal” or “timeless”. The coming into existence of Sanatan Sangeet Sanskriti is the result of the efforts of a group of lovers of music and dance to find a promoting-forum-cum-research-institute for music, dance and other Indian arts. In India, it is believed that the divine principle which was all pervading, before becoming and evolving into the material worlds viz., the Earth, the Planets, the Sun & the Stars which are numberless, was in the form of sound – Nadha Brahman – which is symbolized by the mystic word “OM”. Music, dance and art have unifying effect. They transcend religion, language and other seemingly dividing factors. These three are also one. While dance is music in action, art is a kind of frozen music. It is necessary to promote and encourage music, dance and other arts for the sake of harmony, unity and world peace. Music, dance and art will enable man to understand himself better and to realize his true nature. The Sanatan Sangeet Sanskriti has been established with the above objectives in view and proposes to engage in the following activities: Sanatan Sangeet Samman is to honour a senior artist for his / her personal excellence and outstanding contributions to the Indian Classical Music / Dance. The Sanatan Sangeet Puraskar is to honour a talented artist in recognition of his / her talent and potential for excellence. Dr L Subramaniam,

Save the Children India,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_the_Children_India,"Bal Raksha Bharat, commonly known as Save the Children India, is a non-profit organization working to improve the lives of marginalized children in India since 2008. Headquartered in Gurugram, and registered as Bal Raksha Bharat in India (under Societies Registration Act, 1861), the organization is a member of the international Save the Children Alliance. [2] While Save the Children has been working in India since 1940s, Save the Children India formally came into being as Bal Raksha Bharat in April 2008 and has since then reached 10.1 million children through its efforts. The organization implements sustainable, community-driven projects in the remotest corners of India and urban areas to provide quality education and healthcare, protection from harm and abuse and life-saving aid during emergencies to children. Bal Raksha Bharat also works through Advocacy and Campaigning wherein it liaisons with government stakeholders, civil society and mobilizes the masses in support of children’s rights. As the World War I draw to an end in 1919, Eglantyne Jebb launched a movement to cater to the needs of children whose lives were affected by the disastrous war and named it Save the Children Fund. She was driven by the belief that all children have the right to a healthy, happy and fulfilling life. Three years later in 1922, she drafted a document named ‘Declaration of the Rights of the Child’. The declaration contained a number of proclamations intended to provide and safeguard certain universal rights to the children. It was this declaration which would become the axis around with United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) would revolve. In 1924, League of Nation, the precursor to the United Nations adopted Jebb’s declaration. What started as an emergency relief fund went on to become a major worldwide movement for protecting the rights of children. The first connect between Save the Children and India was made when Mahatma Gandhi signed Jebb’s declaration in 1931[3]. In the early 1940s, when World War II broke out, Save the Children provided relief and rehabilitation to the affected children[4]. Hundreds of thousands of children received relief in the form of clothing and shoes. More than 800,000 books were distributed in schools. In India, a child welfare centre in Kolkata was supported and this marked the entry of the organization in India. After the war ended, Save the Children began work with displaced children, refugees and concentration camp survivors in the devastated areas of France, Yugoslavia, Greece, Austria and Poland. In the 1950s and 1960s, Save the Children worked extensively in Asia. Children affected by the Korean War were provided essential relief.  
In 2004, when a devastating Tsunami struck the South-East coast of India, Save the Children provided a rapid relief response which continued for several months[5]. Four years later, in April 2008, Save the Children started functioning as an independent Indian member of the Save the Children International Alliance under the name Bal Raksha Bharat. In 2016, Save the Children launched a global campaign to reach out to the most excluded and forgotten children in the world through aggressive advocacy, fundraising and programme work [6]
(1). The defined objectives for the campaign were: a fair chance for all children should be there, all children should be treated equally and there should be accountability to children.
Bal Raksha Bharat reached 2 lakh street children and 5 lakh of the most vulnerable children as a part of this campaign. Through #TheInvisibles campaign, Bal Raksha Bharat sought to address the most vital issues of children living in street situations [7]
(2). The organization believes that these are perhaps the most deprived children in India, who are all around us yet “invisibles”, that is their issues and needs are often ignored. Through this campaign, the organization worked to address the biggest problem these children face – lack of identity. This was done by the means of providing them an Aadhaar Card and linking them to various government schemes. This is another hallmark campaign of the organization which has been rolled out twice: in the run to 2014 and 2019 General Elections in India [8] (3). Through the campaign, Save the Children prepared a Children’s Manifesto which is a Charter of Demands children have from their political representatives. This manifesto was presented by children in Save the Children’s intervention areas to MPs, MLAs and politicians of various constituencies. An online petition encouraging people to support the campaign was also floated. In 2019, the organisation entered its 100th year globally.

Sevalaya,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevalaya,"Sevalaya is a registered charitable organisation in India. Sevalaya means Temple of Service.[1]  It runs an orphanage in the village of Kasuva near Thiruninravur about 40 km west of Chennai, Tamil Nadu in southern India. It is also engaged in activities for the welfare of the poor and the deprived. Sevalaya runs a free school (recognised by the State Government of Tamil Nadu) for the children at the orphanage and the surrounding village as well as a free medical centre, a free library, a goshala for cows, and an old age home for destitute senior men and women.  All the services are rendered to those in need with the help of philanthropic donations without any discrimination on the basis of caste, colour, religion, language, or gender. The organisation does not receive any grants from the government.  Inspired by the ideals and life of Mahatma Gandhi, Mahakavi Bharathiyar and Swami Vivekananda, V. Muralidharan, along with a group of colleagues formed the charitable trust Sevalaya. Initially a children’s home for poor, orphan and destitute children started functioning on 29 May 1988. The aim of the institution is to provide better opportunities to the poor, orphan and destitute children by fulfilling their basic needs of food, clothing and shelter and also providing value based education and medical care. This would enable them to develop their potentials to the fullest extent possible and blossom, thus contribute towards a better society.  From a humble beginning, with 5 children,  in a rented house in Sivanvoil village in the year 1988, Sevalaya service center now functions from its own campus in nearly 14 acres (57,000 m2) of land at Kasuva Village near Thiruninravur (40 km west of Chennai), sheltering 130 destitute boys and girls, also running a free higher secondary school which provides quality education for 1650 destitute, poor and rural children. The activities of Sevalaya include Swami Vivekananda Boys Home and Mother Teresa Girls Home providing shelter to 130 orphan and destitute boys and girls from broken homes, Mahakavi Bharathiyar Higher Secondary School (recognised by Government of Tamil Nadu but unaided) providing free education through in vernacular to 1650 rural children including the residents of the Homes, Mahatma Gandhiji Medical Centre providing free medical care, Swami Vivekananda Free Library, Kasthurba Craft Centre providing free training in tailoring to rural women, Vinobhaji Goshala sheltering cows, and Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa Old Age Home sheltering 60 destitute senior citizens. These projects have brought about a transformation in the area where Sevalaya is located. The Home provides the basic needs of food, clothing and shelter to the orphan children. The children are also provided with free education and medical facilities. At present there are 130 children in this home. The school provides free education (no fees, free text books and free notebooks and 2 sets of free uniforms) to around 1450 children.  The 3000 families in the area are made up of mostly landless agricultural labourers and brick kiln workers, and most of the children are first generation school goers.  The free school has allowed many of these families to send their children for an education instead of taking them with them to work. Mahatma Gandhiji Medical Centre run by Sevalaya provides free medical care to residents as well as villagers. This has allowed greater access to healthcare in the remote village as the nearest hospital is 6km away.  Minor ailments are treated by the nurse at the centre. Medical camps are arranged almost once a month when teams of specialists from the city visit the institution and conduct check ups for the residents as well as the villagers. With a view to create an awareness about the alternative medical system and nature cure methods, siddha medical camps and nature cure camps are also held. The library has a collection of over 10,000 books including the complete works of Mahatma Gandhi, Mahakavi Bharathi and Swami Vivekananda as well as many newspaper and magazine subscriptions. The library is open to all Sevalaya residents as well as the villagers for free. A mobile library is also sent to the villages nearby every Saturday to make the books available for reading to all the villagers. The library has contributed towards developing reading habit among the village youth. Craft education is a part of the school curriculum and the students are trained in various crafts like wire bag making, book binding, etc., The centre also conducts a free six months certificate course in tailoring for rural women. The women who have completed the course have increased their employment opportunities in the garment industry. The goshala (cow protection centre) shelters around 25 cows (both milk yielding and dry cows). The milk is consumed by the residents of the Orphan Home and the Old Age Home and excess is sold in nearby villages, with the marginal generated income being utilised for meeting the expenses of the institution. A Gobar gas Plant has been constructed which meets 90% of the fuel needs of the Old Age Home.  Organic manure is produced by vermin compost method. The manure is used in the kitchen garden maintained at Sevalaya and also marketed. The Old Age Home provides shelter to poor and destitute old men and women. The residents are encouraged to involve themselves in simple activities like helping in the kitchen by cutting vegetables, watering the garden, etc.",Sevalaya is a registered charitable organisation

Shanti Bhavan,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanti_Bhavan,"The Shanti Bhavan Children's Project (in Hindi: ""haven of peace"") is a U.S. 501(c)(3) and India 80-G non-profit organisation based in Bangalore, India, that operates a pre-K-12 residential school in Baliganapalli, Tamil Nadu.[1] The school annually enrolls 12 boys and 12 girls (at the age of 4 years old) for its incoming pre-school class. Thereafter, students stay at the school year-round except for summer and winter breaks. Students attend Shanti Bhavan free of charge and are provided with nutritional meals, clothes, shelter, education, healthcare and emotional and mental support. Shanti Bhavan is accredited by the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), one of India’s most robust academic curriculums, and administers the ICSE and ISC exams during students' 10th and 12th grades. After students' 12th grade, Shanti Bhavan also pays for their college education. [2] At present, the school accommodates approximately 300 students who come from rural villages or urban slums. A majority (95%) of the students are Dalits - formerly known as untouchables. Due to caste-based discrimination, the students come from extremely impoverished backgrounds, most families surviving on less than $2 per day. Many families experience generational poverty and therefore do not have electricity or running water in their homes. Shanti Bhavan is the only chance for an education that these children have. [3] Students are educated in subjects such as mathematics, history, geography, Hindi, English writing/reading, physics, chemistry, business, accounting, biology, etc. Older students attend workshops in writing, public speaking, and debate. Students are able to engage in sports such as volleyball, basketball, and soccer. Finally, students learn the importance of volunteerism, feminism, leadership, and personal/emotional development. After their Shanti Bhavan education, students go on to join colleges such as St. Joseph's College of Commerce, National Law School in Bangalore, and many more. Current graduates of Shanti Bhavan have obtained full-time jobs at companies such as Amazon, Deloitte, Ernst & Young, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and Yahoo. Furthermore, Shanti Bhavan graduates give back a portion of their salaries to their families and communities, thereby working to extinguish the cycle of generational poverty. The school was founded by Dr. Abraham George, an Indian-American businessman and philanthropist. After serving in the Indian Army, Dr. George attended NYU's Stern School of Business and began his own company Multinational Computer Models Inc. In 1995, he began the non-profit organisation The George Foundation. Shanti Bhavan was established in August 1997 as a project of The George Foundation to help economically and socially disadvantaged children, mostly Dalit children, in rural India - specifically in the Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka regions.[4] In 2008, as a result of the global financial crisis, Shanti Bhavan underwent a financial crisis of its own. Spearheaded by Director of Operations Ajit George, the Shanti Bhavan Children’s Project moved from a privately funded institution to a mixed model of individual donations, corporate and NGO partnerships, and grants. On September 10, 2008, Shanti Bhavan separated from The George Foundation and became a non-profit organisation run under the Shanti Bhavan Educational Trust.[5] As of 2017, Shanti Bhavan has had 8 graduating classes (110 students) and counting. With a 97% high school retention rate and a 98% college retention rate. Its college graduates make more in the first five years of their careers than their parents will their entire lives. Shanti Bhavan students give 20-50% of their incomes to help their families and other children in need. Currently the Shanti Bhavan team is working to raise money to build a second school in India. The organisation aims to provide holistic, quality education to India's most underprivileged children, mostly from the lower caste or the Dalits[6] to  allow them to succeed in the modern global workplace. By breaking the cycle of poverty for these children, while modeling civic engagement and charitable giving, Shanti Bhavan aims to create a generation of changemakers and leaders in India who will go on to uplift their communities out of poverty.[7] The school takes in children as young as four years old who are below poverty level[8]. Shanti Bhavan financially supports them throughout their years at the school as well as through college, providing 17 years of support and high quality education.[9] Shanti Bhavan follows the CISCE curriculum; students take their ISCE examinations in their 10th and 12th grades to determine their college placement. The school employs full-time teachers as well as international volunteers, who are given accommodations on the campus. The volunteers support the student's education by teaching classes and providing a global perspective for students' coursework. Students receive a holistic education, including a focus on global events, feminism, leadership development, and guidance on how to cope with the endemic discrimination they face. The cost per student per day at Shanti Bhavan is approximately $4. For one year, pre-K through 12th grade, the cost is approximately $1600 per student. For one college student, the cost is approximately $3200 per year. Shanti Bhavan has recently been featured in the documentary The Backward Class (2014), as well as the Netflix documentary series Daughters of Destiny: The Journey of Shanti Bhavan (2017),[10] written, directed and co-produced by Vanessa Roth.[11][12] In 2016, Shanti Bhavan student Keerthi was profiled in Glamour’s The Girl Project.[13][14] In 2014, Shanti Bhavan student Visali was honored as one of Glamour’s Women of the Year.[15] Shanti Bhavan has also been featured on or in Charlie Rose, ABC World News Tonight, the New York Times, and Thomas Friedman’s book The World is Flat. The organisation has a volunteer program which employs volunteer educators from some educational and non-profit organisations such as ASTEP (Artists Striving to End Poverty),[16] and She's the First[17] to teach academic and non-academic subjects.[18]",The Shanti Bhavan Children s Project in Hindi haven of peace is a U S 501 c 3 and India 80 G non profit organisation based in Bangalore

Shantmanas,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shantmanas,"Shant Manas ('Shant Manas' meaning 'peaceful mind' in Indian vernacular) is a not-for-profit organization, based in the Tamil Nadu region, South India.  It is a 'free of cost' community-based service dedicated to the support and education of people with mental health difficulties. It offers 'at home' treatments (both pharmacological and talking therapies), counseling and rehabilitation to those who are needy and willing to accept such help. Shant Manas works to promote positive mental health by working in close partnership with families and the local communities. Improving awareness of the importance of mental health and minimizing stigma and discrimination, through regular psychosocial educational programs, within the rural communities that we serve, remains one of our prime objectives. Shant Manas was begun in 2007 by Dr Cahn Vasudevan, a retired Consultant Psychiatrist and Psychotherapist from the UK. His was a simple idea of 'putting back' some of his skills and experience into a small rural community of the country of his origin and making mental health services accessible to a section of people who previously had no such service available to them. Shant Manas began as a small clinical project in 4 villages. Since its inception it has expanded its field of care to 14 villages, with a combined estimated population of about 80,000. It is staffed by three full-time mental health social workers (supported by supervision from 2 sessional psychiatrists) overseeing the psychiatric and social care of 220 service users, with around 50 of them in being in active treatment, as of in May 2015.  
As well as the treatment of psychiatric disorders, Shant Manas aims to provide education on mental health to the local population, reducing stigma and myths surrounding mental health. Due to its success the service continues to expand as demand and awareness of mental health increases. The main body of clinical and social work at Shant Manas is to do with all forms of mental illness and their consequences, but in a very limited sense with difficulties relating to alcohol addiction or learning difficulties. The Shant Manas catchment area covers a rural population, with many informal workers often living in poor economic conditions. As such there is little or no awareness regarding mental health and illness, there are no local services and access to free, urban government treatment is limited or not possible, with no consistent follow-up after treatment. Mental health compounds economic difficulty by keeping able people out of work, creating a negative impact on their families also (in a community in which most households have one wage earner).
Many communities retain the idea that mental health is a product of ‘possession’ or have other mythological roots, and significant stigma is still attached to mental health issues. Because of these beliefs many sufferers (or their families) seek alternative forms of treatment and do not access conventional healthcare. The behaviour of those mentally ill often could trigger in others different emotions such as fear, anger, disgust, etc. which might then lead to a response of hostility or even aggression by neighbors or villagers who do not understand their condition.
Such stigma also creates social limitations on a sufferer’s family and their place in the community, affecting deeper levels of rural society: for instance, a mental illness can force the entire family into the fringes of the community and affect the prospects of a sufferer’s relatives. Shant Manas is community based, relying on word-of-mouth and family referrals for service users to access care. Its approaches to care are: Shantmanas currently services the communities of: Thuvariman, Keelamathur, Melamathur,  Kodimangalam, Melakkal, Katapulli Nagar, Depethar Santhai, Kachirairuppu, Keelamatayan, Thenkarai, Oothukuli, Narayanapuram, T. Pudur, Mullipallam, Achampathu, Sholavandan and Nagamalai. Initiated in 2014 by Dr Pablo Curras, a Canadian psychiatrist volunteering with Shant Manas, Pablo’s Group is a meeting for service users and their carers or families. It is focused on boosting the self-confidence and social skills of service users (who, due to their conditions, may have been ostracized or have little social contact). Although the session is a free structure its core themes are psycho-social education, friendship and communication, and games or activities during the group are aimed at building upon any or all of these. It also teaches relaxation and exercise regimes such as simple yoga routines.
The group, held once every three weeks, has an attendance of around 10-15 people (both service users and their families), and has received positive feedback from those accessing it. Placement work is crucial for the Indian social work syllabus and Shant Manas is actively involved in healthcare education. It accepts a wide variety of local students and international volunteers. Social work and nursing students from local Universities in Madurai opt for placements with Shant Manas and a variety of healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses and social workers from overseas have volunteered. The organization’s novel approach to home-based care offers a different insight into home-based care and students and volunteers alike are able to influence treatment and healthcare plans. The opportunity for students to improve their own skills is also available – students are encouraged to formulate their own assessments and give presentations on case studies.
A quarterly mental health seminar for local students is also given at the Shant Manas site as an educational tool and synergist alongside the Indian social work syllabus.",Shant Manas Shant Manas

Formerly known as Tibetan Transit School, the Sherab Gatsel Lobling School was established on 7 March 1993, to provide education of new arrived young Tibetan people aged between 18 and 30 into the North Indian exile. Incepted on 1 April 1993, the school is administered by the Tibetan Reception Centre, which handed over the charge to the department of education in February 2002. The school has offered education to over 6,400 students since its inception. Around more than 400 students get a five-year education with courses in Tibetan and English languages, computer courses, vocational courses in tailoring and painting by about 50 teachers and staff members.[1] The school comprises dormitories for boys and girls, and a teaching building and houses for the teachers. Usually these young adults may not been integrated into the Indian public school system. Living too far away from public schools, Tibetans who grow up in the rural areas of Tibet often have no possibility to attend a basic scholar education.

Culturally, the population features large extended families requiring greater financial resources to sustain themselves. The unemployment rate is overwhelming, and much of this can be traced to the lack of employable skills or a mismatch between the skills of the residents and those required by regional industries. Government initiatives in relation to poverty alleviation programs, housing, nutrition, education, and skill development are mostly on paper and there is little or no positive impact of state intervention on the Mushers. Deprived of both capital and skill, Mushars have remained trapped in a cycle of poverty for centuries.

With over 6,000 member fishermen, organised through 100 primary societies in eight districts of Southern peninsular India, SIFFS over the last two decades has kept its focus on strengthening the artisanal fisheries.

The death toll in India is mainly in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh. Naturally, the fisherpeople are the worst hit. Thousands have died, several fishing villages were just wiped away. SIFFS actively participated in the relief and rehabilitation activities mainly in Nagapattinam and Kanyakumari districts of Tamil Nadu. SIFFS focussed on these two districts for two reasons: first, these are the districts that have been affected the worst. Secondly, these are the districts where SIFFS has its presence through primary fishermen societies. At Nagapattinam, SIFFS was instrumental in founding the NGO Co-ordination and Resource Centre (NCRC). Policy Research and Documentation forms a thrust area of SIFFS operations. Educating the policy makers, fisherfolk and other people by entering into dialogues with them is undertaken as part of policy research and documentation. To this end, SIFFS has undertaken many research projects, singly and jointly with following objectives. Documentation Centre SIFFS is in the process of standardising its documentation system. The documentation centre at present has 1,265 books that include 824 fishery related books coming under seven main categories and 20 sub-categories and 441 non-fishery books falling under 11 categories.

Its aim was to train shorthand writers.[2] In 2005, The Guild, in association with The Steno Trust, United States, launched a new system of shorthand called Newrite. It was invented by the American Scientist, Walter P. Kistler.[3] Its key proponent Mr. S.V. Ramaswamy developed the institution to a great extent by bringing into being a lot of Government sponsored courses that offers free education on Computers, Shorthand, Accountancy, Personality Development, Spoken English, Bank Coaching etc., to all poor and needy at free of cost.

Tibetan Nuns Project,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Nuns_Project,"The Tibetan Nuns Project is a non-profit organization founded in 1987 dedicated to educating and supporting female Buddhist monastics in India from all Tibetan Buddhist lineages.[2]  It supports nuns interested in study and higher ordination.[3] The mission of the Tibetan Nuns Project is to educate and empower nuns of the Tibetan Buddhist tradition as teachers and leaders; and to establish, strengthen, and support educational institutions to preserve the Tibetan religion and culture. The organization supports seven nunneries and over 700 nuns in India. Gompas (Buddhist convents) have historically been well established in Tibet, certainly from the twelfth century and with traditions reaching back as far as the eighth century.  Before the Chinese invasion in 1949, there were at least 818 nunneries and nearly 28,000 nuns living in Tibet. Traditional education in the nunneries included reading, writing, and lessons in ancient scriptures and prayers taught by the senior nuns or lamas from monasteries. Traditional activities for the nuns included performance of rituals requested by the lay community and crafts such as embroidery and sewing. Administrative and maintenance tasks were rotated so that all nuns gained experience in running the nunnery. In recent years, due to the repressive conditions in Tibet, an influx of nuns have arrived to join the refugee communities in India and Nepal.  Ranging in age from pre-teen to mid-eighties, these nuns come from all parts of Tibet and from many different backgrounds.  Upon arrival in India, many nuns are suffering severely from the stresses of their long, arduous and often dangerous journeys of escape.  Some have faced torture and imprisonment at the hands of the Chinese authorities in Tibet and are enduring immense physical and emotional pain.  In most cases, the nuns arrive without money or possessions. In the mid 80s, under the auspices of the Department of Religion and Culture of the 14th Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Women's Association, the Tibetan Nuns Project (TNP) was established to assist the refugee nuns from Tibet as well as to improve the overall status and level of ordained Tibetan women.  The main objectives of the project are to provide basic care for these women, and educate them in traditional values and philosophy, as well as the essential skills and knowledge needed to function in the modern world.  The Tibetan Nuns Project also works to establish a role for ordained women as teachers and leaders comparable to that of monks. The Tibetan Nuns Project works to: Dolma Ling Nunnery and Institute, built and fully supported by the Tibetan Nuns Project, was the first institute dedicated specifically to higher education for Tibetan Buddhist nuns. It is open to nuns from all traditions. Upon graduation from a nineteen-year program, the nuns will be thoroughly trained in their Buddhist tradition and will be eligible to receive a Geshe degree (Geshema for women), equivalent to a Ph.D. in Tibetan Buddhism. Shugsep Nunnery, a Nyingma nunnery, was re-established in India and is fully supported by the Tibetan Nuns Project. The nunnery traces its lineage back to some of the greatest female teachers in Tibetan Buddhism. Upon completion of a nine-year academic program, nuns receive a lopon degree (equivalent to a M.A.) and may then do research towards obtaining a khenpo degree (equivalent to a Ph.D.). These nuns will then be able to give the full Nyingma teachings to other monastics. Gaden Choeling Nunnery, a Gelug institution, is the oldest Dharamsala nunnery. Karma Drubgyu Thargay Ling or Tilokpur Nunnery, a Kagyu institution, provides scriptural and ritual training and has a basic study program. Sherap Choling in the Spiti Valley has 45 resident nuns who have begun a rigorous course of study, the first of its kind for women of that region. Sakya Nuns Institute in Mundawala near Dehradun will offer the full course of studies followed by the monks of Sakya College. The Project is primarily funded by generous donations from individuals and organizations. Institutional funding has come from the Heinrich Böll Foundation of Germany, the Norwegian Tibet Committee Women's Group and the Norwegian organizations Fokus and Norad, the Swedish foundation Soir-IM, the American Himalayan Foundation, Rigpa Foundation of London, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Hershey Family Foundation, and the Betsy Gordon Foundation. The sponsorship program is funded by individuals world-wide through monthly or yearly contributions. The sponsorships provide food, shelter, medical care, and education to the nuns. Sponsors receive a photo and biography and contact information for the nun(s) that they sponsor.

Wildlife SOS,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_SOS,"Wildlife SOS (WSOS) is a conservation non-profit in India, established in 1995 with the primary objective of rescuing and rehabilitating wildlife in distress in the country, and preserving India’s natural heritage. It is currently one of the largest Wildlife Organisations in South Asia. Although internationally known for groundbreaking work of eradicating the cruel and barbaric practice of dancing bears from the streets of India while creating alternative livelihoods for the nomadic communities that depended on the exploitation of the bears, WSOS is also known for their efforts at rescue and rehabilitation of sloth bears and more recently elephants. Wildlife SOS also runs active projects focused on mitigation of human wildlife conflict with regard to species like leopards, macaques, elephants, moon bears, snakes, and other animals across several states in India. In addition, their work includes projects targeted at biodiversity and habitat conservation, awareness workshops and anti-poaching operations, as well as the rehabilitation of communities dependent on performing or working animals for their livelihood. Wildlife SOS was founded in 1995 by Kartick Satyanarayan and Geeta Seshamani with the motive of protecting and preserving India's natural heritage, forests and wildlife. Initially dedicated to the eradication of the centuries-old practice of 'dancing' bears, the organisation now runs several projects across the country focused on rescuing wildlife in distress, mitigating man-animal conflict, habitat restoration, raising awareness, training enforcement officers, conducting scientific research and conservation studies, combating illegal wildlife poaching and trafficking and rehabilitating wildlife-dependent communities.[1] Wildlife SOS aims to protect and preserve India’s wildlife, run rehabilitation and rescue centres for wildlife, conserve habitats, raise awareness, conduct research, study biodiversity and provide sustainable alternative livelihoods for communities otherwise dependent on wildlife to earn a livelihood. The sloth bear (Melurus ursinus) is a medium-sized omnivorous species of bear found in the Indian subcontinent, predominantly India, with a small population in Nepal and Bhutan, and a sub-species in Sri Lanka. It is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red list.[2] One of the major causes of this is the exploitation of sloth bears as ‘dancing’ bears by members of a nomadic tribe known as the Kalandars or Qalandars (a trade declared illegal under the Wildlife Protection Act 1972),[3] poaching and mistreatment of the animals to support the same, and trafficking of bear parts for use in traditional Chinese medicine – contributing to the declining numbers of sloth bears in the wild.[4] Wildlife SOS is credited with the eradication of the ‘dancing bear’ practice in India,[5] rescuing bears from abusive owners and poachers and rehabilitating them in one of four centers in India- 1. Agra Bear Rescue Facility (2000) in Agra 2. Bannerghatta Bear Rescue Facility (2005) in Karnataka 3. Van Vihar Bear Rescue Facility (2006) in Bhopal 4. Purulia Bear Rescue Centre (2007) in West Bengal Here, the bears are given the medical care required, fed and allowed to socialize and roam in large, free-range areas. So far, more than 640 sloth bears have been rehabilitated by the organization. Wildlife SOS also carries out ex-situ conservation studies on the bears to enhance existing conservation measures for the species’ survival and provides sustainable, alternative livelihoods to the bears’ former owners and their families.[6] The Indian elephant (Elephas maximus indicus) is one of three recognized subspecies of the Asian elephant, native to mainland Asia and is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red list.[7] Elephants are under threat due to poaching, habitat destruction, man-animal conflict and encroachment. Ignorance and a lack of awareness have resulted in the continuous enslavement of these animals as working elephants- to beg, for display in temples, for performances and entertainment, ceremonies and physical labour.[7] Wildlife SOS works in collaboration with the Government of India’s Project Elephant and in partnership with the Haryana Forest Department at Ban Santour and the Uttar Pradesh Forest Department at Mathura to confiscate abused and mistreated elephants and provide them safe and healthy retirement in one of the two elephant sanctuaries it manages - the Elephant Conservation and Care Centre (set up in 2011) in Mathura[8] and the Elephant Rescue Centre (set up in 2010) in Haryana.[9] Wildlife SOS is currently caring for 23 rehabilitated elephants at these two centers. Medical treatment is made available for injured or sick elephants, and handlers, known as mahouts, are trained in humane treatment and management of the animals to improve their working conditions and reduce illicit poaching and mistreatment of the animals. In 2014, Wildlife SOS announced its mission to rescue the then 67 remaining elephants from circuses in India. The Wildlife SOS Elephant Conservation and Care Centre (ECCC) was established in 2009 in collaboration with the Uttar Pradesh Forest Department to address the conservation issues facing Asian elephants in India. The main objectives of the centre are to eradicate illegal trafficking and holding of elephants, creating a platform for public awareness about the threats faced by Asian elephants, and ensuring the safety and protection of elephants in the wild while pioneering humane, modern and scientific management of elephants in India as a replacement of traditional methods of management that are fraught with risks to the elephants, owners and mahouts.[10][11] ECCC serves as a model centre where humane management and training of elephants is practiced in a country where traditional management methods involving abuse and starvation have been in wide use for centuries. In 2018, Wildlife SOS established India's first elephant hospital at its Elephant Conservation and Care Centre to provide specialized medical treatment to sick and aged elephants.[12][13][14] The Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus), also called the Moon bear, is one of four species of bear found in India. The range of the Asiatic black bear extends across the Himalayas, from Bhutan to Pakistan. It is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red list.[15] Wildlife SOS works in Kashmir to mitigate human-animal conflict that arises when bears wander into human settlements, incidents of which increase with deforestation and encroachment. Wildlife SOS has been working with the Jammu and Kashmir Wildlife Protection Department and the Forest Department since 2007, attempting to mitigate the conflict situation in the area. As part of this project, known as the Moon Bear Conservation Project, Wildlife SOS conducts training workshops for the staff of the J&K Wildlife Protection Department with focus on capacity building and training in the use of specialized tranquilizing equipment and avoidance behaviour, carries out extensive studies on man-animal conflict situations and treats and rehabilitates animals that fall victim to confrontation- in particular moon bears and leopards. If possible, the animals are released back into the wild, else they are cared for and treated by Wildlife SOS staff at centers in Pahalgam and Dachigam in Kashmir.[16] The leopard (Panthera pardus) is one of five big cats found in India (also found in Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Pakistan) and is listed as near-threatened on the IUCN Red List.[17] The animals are under threat due to a variety of factors, including but not limited to habitat encroachment and poaching. The scrub jungle of Maharashtra was ideal habitat for the leopard until incentives for the cultivation of sugarcane lead to rampant callous farming practices and encroachment of the leopards’ habitat, causing man-animal conflict to escalate.[18] In 2008, Wildlife SOS collaborated with the state government on the expansion of the existing Manikdoh Leopard Rescue Centre in Junnar, near Pune, which currently houses 30 leopards.[19] In addition, Wildlife SOS veterinarians and biologists conduct awareness workshops and training programs for local communities, the Forest Department, law enforcement, educational institutions and forums to help raise awareness and mitigate conflict situations.[20] Wildlife SOS’ habitat conservation project is situated near the Ram Durga valley in Koppal, Karnataka, and aims at protecting critical sloth bear habitat, threatened by illegal mining activities, rampant deforestation and encroachment by human settlements and industries which, along with poaching, massacred the wildlife of the region. In 2007, Wildlife SOS purchased nearly 40 acres of land in the region, creating a crucial wildlife corridor by allowing at-risk habitats to link up with a patch of Reserve Forest.[21] The project was expanded in 2012, with the acquisition of an additional 10 acres of land, made possible by the support of BHEL, PSSR, Chennai. In consultation with experts, appropriate species of vegetation were selected and an extensive afforestation project was undertaken- planting nearly 10,000 saplings. A bore well, drip irrigation system and solar powered electrical fencing were acquired. Local community members were employed to manage and patrol the land, allowing the project to achieve a 90% plant survival rate in just 2–3 years. The vegetation flourished and, in areas where conservation efforts had been initiated earlier, species of wildlife have begun returning, including sloth bear, leopards and endangered species like the pangolin and star tortoise. In addition, Wildlife SOS works with local communities and stakeholders, and works to educate them so as to increase their involvement in forest protection. The organization works to secure agricultural land along forested area, to serve as safe buffers for wildlife. Wildlife SOS works to curb the illegal trade and trafficking of wildlife and wildlife products - birds, mammals and reptiles, along with skins, bones and other body parts harvested from poached animals. Efforts at eradicating the practice of ‘dancing’ bears and related poaching have resulted in a marked reduction in bear poaching as per statistics. However, it still persists to feed demand in neighboring countries and Wildlife SOS has had to rescue more than 73 sloth bear cubs from poachers over ten years. Wildlife SOS’ anti-poaching squad, Forest Watch, consists of a complex network of informants gathering critical information on poachers and criminals involved in the illegal wildlife trade.[22] Forest Watch has assisted the forest department, the police department and law enforcement agencies to crack down on traffickers and smugglers, recover animal skins, body parts, ivory and sometimes live animals from poachers, and even provide legal assistance where required.[23][24] Wildlife SOS offers further assistance by conducting grassroots-level training workshops focusing on capacity building and wildlife crime prevention in the field. Understanding that human involvement is crucial to conservation efforts, Wildlife SOS works with local communities in urban and rural areas to educate people regarding their local wildlife and ecosystem. Programs focus on teaching locals how to live sustainably with their environment, helping people deal with man-animal conflict in vulnerable areas and involving locals in conservation efforts such as tree-plantation drives in Jammu and Kashmir, plastic removal drives in Bannerghatta and cleaning the Dal lake with the help of students from local schools and colleges.[25] Wildlife SOS also routinely hosts workshops with law officers, forest department enforcement officers, police and customs officials to educate them about the wildlife trade, recognition of contraband, basic understanding of related law in the field, conflict mitigation and rescue techniques to control human-animal conflict.[26][27] In addition to its conservation projects, Wildlife SOS runs a 24-hour animal rescue with a team trained to perform emergency rescues of wild animals in three states – Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat. The initiative was started in 1998, and now responds to nearly 300 rescue calls a month. The team rescues animals and birds that have been injured, abandoned or trapped in urban areas. Common rescues include monkeys, jackals, snakes, monitor lizards, deer and birds.[28][29][30] These are given immediate medical attention and then released in suitable, safer locations in the presence of Forest Department officials. If release is not possible, the animals are relocated to the WSOS Rescue Centre in Gurgaon, set up in 1999. Since 2010, Wildlife SOS has been working in collaboration with the Gujarat Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (GSPCA) to rescue wildlife trapped in urban localities, particularly snakes and crocodiles in Gujarat. Wildlife SOS’s rescue team has animal-control contracts with Indira Gandhi Airport,[31][32] Delhi Golf Club, Agra Developmental Authority,[33] Delhi Jal Board, Akbars Tomb,[34] residential colonies in the city and the Commonwealth Games village for the 2010 Commonwealth games hosted in India.[citation needed] As part of its project to eradicate the erstwhile practice of dancing bears in India, Wildlife SOS runs a simultaneous rehabilitation program for the Qalandar (Kalandar) tribals, for whom the bears provided a source of livelihood.[35] The program, started in 2001, includes incentives for the bear-owners, in the form of sustainable livelihood alternatives. Wildlife SOS may provide seed funds for ventures or assist in the purchase of shops, handcarts, bicycles, cycle-rickshaws, auto-rickshaws or something that could support an alternative career for the individual, as well as providing training for alternative jobs as drivers, small scale poultry or goat farmers, metallurgy or gem-cutting and stone polishing for costume jewelry. Rehabilitated tribals form nearly 50% of the workforce at Wildlife SOS’ rescue centres. Wildlife SOS also organizes vocational courses and seed funding for the womenfolk of the community to start businesses in the states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, sets up self-help groups and provides them with marketing links, wherever necessary. This allows them to become secondary breadwinners for the family and empowers them through financial independence. Further, Wildlife SOS provides educational opportunities for the children of Kalandars, helping them break out of the cycle of poverty and oppression and eliminating dependency on ‘dancing’ bears for income, thereby reducing poaching and mistreatment of the animals.[36] Wildlife SOS is also involved in the rehabilitation of other traditionally wildlife-dependent communities including the Saperas, an originally nomadic, Muslim tribe of snake-charmers, hiring the community members to work with them as animal rescue workers.

profit in India established in 1995 with the primary objective of rescuing and rehabilitating wildlife in distress in the country and preserving India s natural heritage It is currently one of the largest Wildlife Organisations in South Asia Although internationally known for groundbreaking work of eradicating the cruel and barbaric practice of dancing bears from the streets of India while creating alternative livelihoods for the nomadic communities that depended on the exploitation of the bears WSOS is also known for their efforts at rescue and rehabilitation of sloth bears and more recently elephants Wildlife SOS also runs active projects focused on mitigation of human wildlife conflict with regard to species like leopards macaques elephants moon bears snakes and other animals across several states in India In addition their work includes projects targeted at biodiversity and habitat conservation awareness workshops and anti poaching operations as well as the rehabilitation of communities dependent on performing or working animals for their livelihood Wildlife SOS was founded in 1995 by Kartick Satyanarayan and Geeta Seshamani with the motive of protecting and preserving India s natural heritage forests and wildlife Initially dedicated to the eradication of the centuries old practice of dancing bears the organisation now runs several projects across the country

The sloth bear Melurus ursinus is a medium sized omnivorous species of bear found in the Indian subcontinent predominantly India with a small population in Nepal and Bhutan and a sub species in Sri Lanka It is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red list One of the major causes of this is the exploitation of sloth bears as dancing bears by members of a nomadic tribe known as the Kalandars or Qalandars a trade declared illegal under the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 poaching and mistreatment of the animals to support the same and trafficking of bear parts for use in traditional Chinese medicine contributing to the declining numbers of sloth bears in the wild Wildlife SOS is credited with the eradication of the dancing bear practice in India rescuing bears from abusive owners and poachers and rehabilitating them in one of four centers in India 1 Agra Bear Rescue Facility 2000 in Agra 2 Bannerghatta Bear Rescue Facility 2005 in Karnataka 3 Van Vihar Bear Rescue Facility 2006 in Bhopal 4 Purulia Bear Rescue Centre 2007 in West Bengal Here the bears are given the medical care required fed and allowed to socialize and roam in large free range areas So far more than 640 sloth bears have been rehabilitated by the organization Wildlife SOS also carries out ex situ conservation studies on the bears to enhance existing conservation measures for the species survival and provides sustainable alternative livelihoods to the bears former owners and their families The Indian elephant Elephas maximus indicus is one of three recognized subspecies of the Asian elephant native to mainland Asia and is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red list Elephants are under threat due to poaching habitat destruction man animal conflict and encroachment Ignorance and a lack of awareness have resulted in the continuous enslavement of these animals as working elephants to beg for display in temples for performances and entertainment ceremonies and physical labour Wildlife SOS works in collaboration with the Government of India s Project Elephant and in partnership with the Haryana Forest Department at Ban Santour and the Uttar Pradesh Forest Department at Mathura to confiscate abused and mistreated elephants and provide them safe and healthy retirement in one of the two elephant sanctuaries it manages the Elephant Conservation and Care Centre set up in 2011 in Mathura and the Elephant Rescue Centre set up in 2010 in Haryana Wildlife SOS is currently caring for 23 rehabilitated elephants at these two centers Medical treatment is made available for injured or sick elephants and handlers known as mahouts are trained in humane treatment and management of the animals to improve their working conditions and reduce illicit poaching and mistreatment of the animals In 2014 Wildlife SOS announced its mission to rescue the then 67 remaining elephants from circuses in India The Wildlife SOS Elephant Conservation and Care Centre ECCC was established in 2009 in collaboration with the Uttar Pradesh Forest Department to address the conservation issues facing Asian elephants in India The main objectives of the centre are to eradicate illegal trafficking and holding of elephants creating a platform for public awareness about the threats faced by Asian elephants and ensuring the safety and protection of elephants in the wild while pioneering humane modern and scientific management of elephants in India as a replacement of traditional methods of management that are fraught with risks to the elephants owners and mahouts ECCC serves as a model centre where humane management and training of elephants is practiced in a country where traditional management methods involving abuse and starvation have been in wide use for centuries In 2018 Wildlife SOS established India s first elephant hospital at its Elephant Conservation and Care Centre to provide specialized medical treatment to sick and aged elephants The Asiatic black bear Ursus thibetanus
